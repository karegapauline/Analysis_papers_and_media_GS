	abstract = {The fast-growing sensing technology means there is an extensive range of low-cost indoor air quality (IAQ) devices or sensor modules readily available on the commercial market. However, less attention has been paid to exploring people’s perceptions and responses to indoor air pollution. Such knowledge is deemed important for improving the design of future IAQ sensors, enhancing public awareness and providing guidance on ways to improve indoor environmental conditions. This study aimed to explore people’s perceptions and responses to IAQ under different quasi-experimental environmental conditions and levels of information. The study is reported from the perspective of 16 staff and students at a UK university, held within a prototype smart and modular home built on campus. It compares questionnaire survey responses and focus group interview discussions with actual IAQ concentrations and other influential indoor parameters (indoor air temperature and relative humidity). Study outcomes revealed the importance of understanding contextual factors when developing feedback and communication strategies to best improve people’s awareness, acceptance, and behavioural responses to IAQ. Findings highlight the usefulness of focus group discussions in the design of future IAQ sensors.},

It looks at how, and the extent to which, LA air quality policies align with AAQD requirements, thus advancing empirical and academic knowledge on implementation literature surrounding multi-level governance, specifically the policy disconnect between the AAQD and UK Local Air Quality Management (LAQM). The application of the framework shows how LAs can better integrate AQAPs into their LAQM plans to assess, develop, improve and implement their air quality policies on the ground.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Governments worldwide increasingly emphasize collaboration with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in healthcare. However, research on the challenges faced by NGOs, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, remains limited. This study aims to explore these challenges from the perspectives of healthcare managers and NGO leaders in Iran, a low-middle-income country.
Method
A qualitative study was conducted using 54 semi-structured interviews with managers from the governmental healthcare sector and active NGO leaders at the national level between 2023 and 2024. Data were analyzed using the framework analysis method in Atlas.T software.
Result
The study identified five key categories of challenges affecting NGO-government collaboration: political issues (e.g., policy instability and leadership changes), operational issues (e.g., inefficiencies in collaboration processes), cultural issues (e.g., mutual distrust between stakeholders), managerial issues (e.g., insufficient support and capacity-building), and communication issues (e.g., weak networks and lack of awareness about NGO roles).
Conclusion
This study offers a practical framework for addressing the identified challenges, particularly in developing countries. Specific recommendations include establishing consistent policies to ensure stability, simplifying collaboration procedures, and fostering mutual respect between NGOs and government agencies. These measures can enhance NGO effectiveness, ultimately improving healthcare service delivery and patient outcomes.},

Within urban settings, the NO2 column levels are a good proxy indicator to show the quality of ambient air. The purpose of this study was to investigate the tropospheric nitrogen dioxide column levels during the year 2020 over four megacities in Southern Africa Region (Gaborone, Harare, Johannesburg and Maputo). Data were derived from AURA OMI complemented by the HYSPLIT Model-NCEP/ NCAR Reanalysis and GEOS-5 Model-MERRA 2. Findings were that the city of Johannesburg recorded the highest NO2 column levels during 2020 at 14.07 × 1015 molecules per cm2 recorded in the winter season while the city of Harare recorded the lowest NO2 column levels at 0.36 × 1015 molecules per cm2 which were recorded in spring. This present study also confirmed that 90 \% of the year the cities were under the influence of long-range air masses originating from both the South Atlantic and the Indian Ocean however the city of Harare's tropospheric NO2 seemed more regionally determined than those of Johannesburg, Gaborone and Maputo. On the other hand, the city of Gaborone NO2 column levels was seemingly under the influence of the South African Highveld. Besides, its local emissions the city also received long-range transport air masses from the Indian Ocean thus getting influenced. The study highlighted the phenomenon of transboundary air pollution over Southern Africa cities and brought to foe the need to adopt a uniform Southern Africa policy and guidelines on air quality management.},

Radon exposure, especially near tailings, is a significant public health threat, potentially leading to increased risk of lung cancer, leukemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). These health problems are often associated with lower survival rates and significant financial burdens. This ongoing research aim to evaluating the relationship between indoor radon exposure and lung cancer, leukemia, and COPD risks among residents proximal to gold mine tailings in Gauteng Province, South Africa. This cross-sectional preliminary study focus on two distinct groups: Riverlea (exposed group, {\textless}2 km to Gold mine tailings) and Orlando East (unexposed group, {\textgreater}2 km to Gold mine tailings). Indoor radon levels is measured using AlphaE monitors, while health risks (lung cancer, leukemia, and COPD) linked to exposure are evaluated through interview-administered questionnaire and secondary data from Gauteng Health Department. Of the 476 residents randomly selected for this study, 300 have already participated, with balanced representation from both the exposed and unexposed groups. The study will compare indoor radon levels and health outcomes between the two groups. This study’s results could aid in creating targeted interventions and policies to mitigate indoor radon exposure risks and safeguard vulnerable communities from this significant public health hazard.},

	abstract = {Air pollution remains one of the leading global environmental-health challenges the world is facing today, particularly within urban environments. amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, air pollution has been brought back into the spotlight as both attack the human respiratory systems. The purpose of the study was to investigate the quality of ambient air in a low-income urban settlement of Jabavu located within the City of Johannesburg during the year 2018. Air pollution and meteorological data were gathered from the South African Air Quality System network. The study focused on three pollutants namely PM10, SO2 and O3. Findings were that the seasonal ambient mean concentrations for PM10 in summer was (28.99 µg/m3), autumn (33.32 µg/m3), winter (61.71 µg/m3) and spring (48.44 µg/m3). On the other hand, the seasonal ambient mean concentrations for SO2 was summer (4.45ppb), autumn (3.19ppb), winter (5.65ppb) and spring (3.54ppb). The O3 seasonal ambient mean concentrations were summer (40.97ppb), autumn (21.01ppb), winter (15.90ppb) and spring (33.59ppb). Furthermore, the study observed that in summer, winter and spring the dominant long-range transport air masses originated from the South Atlantic Ocean, Madagascar Island-India Ocean and the Indian Ocean while in autumn the dominant air masses are short-range inland air masses. For SO2 and PM10, ambient concentrations were found to be more problematic during winter; while for O3 substantial levels were unexpectedly recorded in summer. When analysing the diurnal profiles of PM10, SO2 and O3, each of these pollutants revealed a unique distribution pattern, which, despite having seasonal variance, was consistent throughout the year. For instance, irrespective of the season, PM10 mostly peaked in the mornings and evenings; meanwhile SO2 and O3 often spiked during the midday and mid-afternoon, respectively. These findings indicate that air quality within this low-income settlement is poor. To improve air quality within low-income settlements there is a need for a shift from reliance on solid fuels to cleaner energy sources such as LP gas, biogas and solar accompanied by an increase in community awareness about air quality issues. This study contributes to knowledge building within the air quality monitoring scientific community while for policymakers it assists in policy formulation to enable air quality management.},

	abstract = {Background:Rolling blackouts (planned power outages) are common in low- and middle-income countries, including South Africa. Recently, South Africa has experienced longer and more frequent rolling blackouts owing to its reliance on an aging electricity grid, among other challenges. During rolling blackouts, parts of the electricity grid are shut down, and the loss of power in homes, businesses, and industries across vast areas leads to a breakdown of key amenities required for environmental health.Objectives:This commentary contextualizes the existing consequences and potential implications of rolling blackouts for environmental health in South Africa.Discussion:We examined key areas where rolling blackouts affect environmental health, including water and sanitation, air quality, food safety, and socioeconomic challenges. Power outages have led to contamination of freshwater bodies with raw sewage due to resultant interruptions of wastewater treatment works. The use of generators and burning of dirty fuels during blackouts have added to outdoor and household air pollution. Rolling blackouts also expose people to unsafe food. Finally, we discuss some ways forward and the benefits of using renewable energy sources. A critical evaluation of these impacts underscores the urgent need for more sustainable energy solutions that safeguard environmental health in South Africa. https://doi.org/10.1289/JHP1090},

We undertook a review of published and grey literature to identify key reforms that had been implemented by the NHIF since 2010. We examined the reforms undertaken by the NHIF using a health financing evaluation framework that considers the feasibility, equity, efficiency, and sustainability of health financing mechanisms. We found the following NHIF reforms: (1) the introduction of the Civil Servants Scheme (CSS), (2) the introduction of a stepwise quality improvement system, (3) the health insurance subsidy for the poor (HISP), (4) revision of monthly contribution rates and expansion of the benefit package, and (5) the upward revision of provider reimbursement rates. Though there are improvements in several areas, these reforms raise equity, efficiency, feasibility, and sustainability concerns. The article concludes that though NHIF reforms in Kenya are well intentioned and there has been improvement in several areas, design attributes could compromise the extent to which they achieve their intended goal of providing universal financing risk protection to the Kenyan population.},

This paper develops and applies an integrated systemic approach to explore the state of air quality management in Nairobi, Kenya; as an LMIC exemplar city. The urban diagnostics approach developed assesses current particulate matter air pollution in Nairobi; quantifies anthropogenic emissions for the years 2015 and 2020 and projects scenarios of impacts of actions and inactions to 2030. This was combined with a review of grey literature on air quality policies, urban development and interviews with key stakeholders. The analysis suggests that commendable progress has been made to improve air quality in Nairobi but continuing hazardous levels of air pollution still require concerted policy efforts. Data available for numerical simulations have low spatial resolution and are generated from global emission inventories that can miss or misrepresent local emission sources. The current air quality data gap that needs to be addressed are highlighted. Strong political support is required to ensure that current air quality improvement approaches are evidence based to achieve long-term sustainability goals.},

Higher exposure to these fine particles, which are difficult to perceive by the eye, would contribute to an increased risk of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, as well as lung cancers. Low-cost sensor-based technologies are now emerging as an effective alternative to monitoring the concentration of particulate matter in ambient air. This technology also has the advantage of being less complex and therefore can involve more citizen participation. A concrete example on the African continent is the initiative of the Sensor.Africa project is based on the involvement and commitment of citizens to collect and share this data for free in their cities. Among more than 25 cities on the continent where the project has already been launched is the city of Kisumu in Kenya where it has been implemented since February 2019. The process used to deploy and process the data from the low-cost sensors was explained in detail for better understanding. The deployment of these sensors can open up a plethora of opportunities, but it also rises a number of challenges for effective air quality monitoring. In our case, the data obtained after sensor calibration sometimes suffer from a lack of accuracy and outliers. Therefore, data visualisation techniques are used to solve this problem before analysing and proposing perspectives for further use by different stakeholders. From a health point of view, few records showed critical values in this city for the PM2.5 and PM10 indicators.},

	abstract = {As Africa experiences unprecedented growth rates in seaborne trade, the pressure on existing port infrastructure intensifies, necessitating the expansion and development of key maritime facilities. The Mombasa Port in Kenya, a critical hub for maritime trade on the continent, exemplifies this phenomenon through its ongoing expansion activities. This study examines the port expansion's social, economic, and environmental effects on the city of Mombasa, its residents, and their marine environments, offering a comprehensive analysis of the port-city-sea nexus within the African context. Employing a mixed-method research design, this study integrates qualitative and quantitative data collection techniques by combining 520 household surveys, Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) with residents and local organizations, and Key Informant Interviews (KII). Quantitative analysis utilized descriptive statistics-frequency distributions, cross-tabulations, ANOVA, Pearson's chi-squared tests and regression analysis. Concurrently, qualitative data were thematically coded ensuring a robust triangulation of findings. The analysis focused on the perceived and observable changes attributed to the port expansion, residents' satisfaction with their Quality of Life (QoL), and environmental conditions, as well as examining economic and livelihood status. Findings indicated that 93\% of the respondents acknowledged that they observed substantial changes in their vicinity due to port development, with quality-of-life satisfaction levels varying according to their proximity to recent expansion activities. Notably, those residing closest to the port expansion sites reported higher levels of dissatisfaction due to livelihood disruption, displacement, and environmental destruction. This research fills the existing literary gap around the intricate relationship between port development and urban, terrestrial, and marine environments in Africa. Moreover, it lays a foundation for further studies and provides baseline data that may inform sustainable urban, land, and sea planning in African port cities.},

Data collection in such contexts can be challenging for a variety of ethical, philosophical, theoretical, and methodological reasons which may arise resulting from the use of research approaches designed in the Global North. There are also many practical and infrastructural issues which may be relevant in resource-constrained countries. This paper provides examples of challenges encountered by the authors in a variety of ongoing research projects in the Global South.

	abstract = {Solid waste management (SWM) is one of the key responsibilities of city administrators and one of the effective proxies for good governance. Effective SWM mitigates adverse health and environmental impacts, conserves resources, and improves the livability of cities. However, unsustainable SWM practices, exacerbated by rapid urbanization and financial and institutional limitations, negatively impact public health and environmental sustainability. This review article assesses the human and environmental health impacts of SWM practices in the Global South cities that are the future of global urbanization. The study employs desktop research methodology based on in-depth analysis of secondary data and literature, including official documents and published articles. It finds that the commonplace SWM practices include mixing household and commercial garbage with hazardous waste during storage and handling. While waste storage is largely in old or poorly managed facilities such as storage containers, the transportation system is often deficient and informal. The disposal methods are predominantly via uncontrolled dumping, open-air incinerators, and landfills. The negative impacts of such practices include air and water pollution, land degradation, emissions of methane and hazardous leachate, and climate change. These impacts impose significant environmental and public health costs on residents with marginalized social groups mostly affected. The paper concludes with recommendations for mitigating the public and environmental health risks associated with the existing SWM practices in the Global South.},

	abstract = {Global changes in climate and land use are threatening natural ecosystems, biodiversity, and the ecosystem services people rely on. This is why it is necessary to track and monitor spatiotemporal change at a level of detail that can inform science, management, and policy development. The current constellation of multiple Landsat and Sentinel-2 satellites collecting imagery at predominantly ≤30-m spatial resolution affords an opportunity for the generation of global medium- resolution products every few days. Our goal is to both identify the information needs and provide direction towards the generation of a suite of global, high-level, systematically-generated, medium-resolution products designed for both management and science. Our vision builds on the success of the NASA MODIS/VIIRS product suite, while recognizing the unique strengths of medium-resolution satellite data given their higher spatial resolution and longer time series. We propose a suite of 13 essential products that enable the characterization of the current state and changes in the biosphere, cryosphere, and hydrosphere, and would fill information needs identified by the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites for the Global Climate Observing System and the Global Terrestrial Observing System, by the National Research Council of the US National Academies in the decadal survey, and by others. These products are: land cover, land cover change, burned area, forest loss, vegetation indices, phenology, dynamic habitat indices, albedo, land surface temperature, snow cover, ice extent, surface water extent, and evapotranspiration. Furthermore, we provide a list of desirable products poised for addition to the essential products (e.g., crop type, emissivity, and ice sheet velocity). Lastly, we suggest aspirational products requiring further algorithm development (e.g., forest structure and crop yield). For the identified essential products, algorithms are in place, making it feasible to begin generating products systematically. These products should be accompanied by quality and accuracy assessments undertaken following consensus protocols. Five decades after the first Landsat satellite, and two decades after the MODIS products were first produced, it is time now for readily available, standardized, and consistent high-level products built upon medium-resolution imagery, thereby fulfilling the promise and the vision that inspired the Landsat program since its inception.},

In view of expanding human land use, increasing climate change and unmet conservation targets, area-based conservation requires efficiency and effectiveness more than ever. In this review, I identify and relate pressing challenges to promising opportunities for effective and efficient protected area governance and management, to enhance research, decision-making and capacity building in area-based conservation under uncertain future developments. I reveal that protected area management is particularly challenged by human land use, climate change, invasive species, and social, political and economic limitations. Protected area management often lacks the continuous availability of data on current states and trends of nature and threats. Biocultural conservation, climate-smart management and biosecurity approaches help to overcome challenges induced by human needs, climate change and invasive species, respectively. Economic valuation and shifts in funding priorities can boost protected area effectiveness and efficiency. In-situ monitoring techniques, remote sensing and open data infrastructures can fill data and information gaps for protected area planning and management. Moreover, adaptive management is an auspicious concept in the framework of systematic conservation planning to ensure the enduring effectiveness of protected areas despite unpredictable future developments. Post-2020 international biodiversity and sustainable development goals could be met earlier if protected areas were more effective. I consequently conclude with the need for a global information system that is to support area-based conservation by synthesizing challenges and opportunities for protected area management effectiveness and efficiency at the local to global level.},

	abstract = {Environmental exposure data are used by decision‐makers to assess environmental risks and implement actions to mitigate risks from contaminants. The first article in this series summarized the available evaluation schemes for environmental exposure data, of which there are few compared to those available for environmental hazard data. The second article covered the assessment of the reliability of environmental exposure data sets under the Criteria for the Reporting and Evaluation of Exposure Data (CREED). The aim of this article is to provide an overview and practical guidance on the relevance assessment in the context of the CREED approach for evaluating exposure monitoring data sets. Systematically considering relevance is critical for both evaluating existing data sets and for optimizing the design of new monitoring studies. Relevance is defined here as the degree of suitability or appropriateness of a data set to address a specific purpose or to answer the questions that have been defined by the assessor or for those generating exposure data. The purpose definition will be the foundation for the relevance assessment, to clarify how the assessor should rate the assessment criteria (fully met, partly met, not met/inappropriate, not reported, not applicable). This will provide transparency for anyone reviewing the outcomes. An explicit gap analysis (i.e., an articulation of the data set limitations for the stated purpose) is an important outcome of the relevance assessment. The relevance evaluation approach is demonstrated with three case studies, all relating to the freshwater aquatic environment, where the data sets are scored as relevant with or without restrictions, not relevant, or not assignable. The case studies represent both organic and inorganic constituents, and have different data characteristics (e.g., percentage of censored data, sampling frequencies, relation to supporting parameters).

Consecutive UK industrial strategies have supported the shift from an NHS that provides free-at-point-of-delivery healthcare to one that also facilitates research. Said to promote healthcare’s triple aim of ‘better health, better healthcare, and lower cost’ (Wachter, 2016, 3), the digitisation of patient records is a core part in opening routine aspects of the health system to potential research. In this paper, we thematically analyse 11 policy documents and ask, how does the NHS discuss its decision to digitise patient records and what are the implications of such practices on the citizen? We document how (1) digitisation is presented as a collective endeavour for patients and NHS professionals, offering new possibilities for patients to participate in their own health and that of the population through research and, (2) digitisation contributes to the building of an efficient health system. Through this analysis we reflect on how discussions of digitisation present uncritically the potential of Electronic Health Records and big data analytics to improve care and generate wealth through research, and reconfigure patienthood, by placing research participation as a routine part of accessing NHS healthcare.},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose: The South African eHealth Strategy was published in 2012 and acknowledges that health information systems should be used to strengthen the public health care system in the country. While the benefit of electronic health information systems has been documented in the literature, the implementation of these systems in public health care in South Africa remains limited. Currently, patient data is still manually recorded in the patient’s file, while data required for monitoring and evaluation purposes is hand written by the nurses in registers, aggregated and only the results entered into electronic health information systems for analysis.Methods: The objective of the paper is to review existing electronic health information systems in public health care in South Africa in terms of their role and focus on health care. A qualitative approach was undertaken to identify the role of health information systems that are most prevalent in public health care in South Africa.Results: The results indicate that the most common role of health information systems include support for  clinical care, e.g. radiology and pathology, as well as monitoring, evaluation and administration purposes. While some systems do capture limited clinical information, there seems to be few systems that support patient centred clinical care.Conclusions: The recommendation of the paper is that the role of health information systems should be expanded to support direct patient care and improve health outcomes for individuals.},

	abstract = {Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems offer extensive opportunities to enhance healthcare delivery in sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries by improving data management and patient care and reducing errors. Nonetheless, EHR systems face a myriad of challenges, ranging from infrastructure and resources to policy, data management, and implementers’ capacitation. This review provides a comprehensive 10-year overview of EHR implementation in the SSA region. A systematic search of PubMed, Web of Science and HINARI databases identified 30 relevant studies published from 2014 to 2024. Inclusion criteria focused on studies discussing the implementation, benefits, and challenges of EHR systems in SSA countries. Data extraction and thematic analysis facilitated the synthesis of findings. The review identified themes organized into four categories: EHR-enabled data management reduced errors, enhanced accuracy, and improved accessibility of patient records. Improved patient care correlated with better data management, facilitating timely and informed decision-making. Challenges such as limited infrastructure (power and connectivity), financial constraints, data privacy concerns, and the need for extensive training were prevalent. User acceptance also emerged as a critical barrier, with healthcare providers often resistant to adopting innovative technologies due to perceived complexity and the time required for training. EHR systems can significantly enhance healthcare delivery in sub-Saharan Africa. To fully realize these benefits, it is crucial to address challenges through targeted strategies and investments. By investing in reliable infrastructure, securing financial support, enhancing data security, developing comprehensive training programmes, and engaging stakeholders, sub-Saharan Africa can improve data management, patient care, and overall healthcare outcomes. Main findings: This study demonstrates how, between 2014 and 2024, the implementation of EHR systems improved patient care by enhancing the accuracy and accessibility of records and reduced data errors, though challenges such as infrastructure limitations, financial constraints, data privacy concerns, and resistance from healthcare workers persisted as barriers to widespread adoption.Added knowledge: This scoping review underscores the transformative potential of EHR systems in data management and patient care in SSA while identifying key challenges such as infrastructure deficiencies and financial constraints and offering strategic guidance for effective adoption to enhance healthcare outcomes and patient satisfaction.Global health impact for policy and action: This study emphasizes the transformative role of EHR systems in improving healthcare delivery in resource-limited settings like sub-Saharan Africa, highlighting critical areas for policy action—such as infrastructure, funding, data security, training, and strategic interventions—to unlock their potential for enhanced global health outcomes and patient satisfaction.

	abstract = {Background:  Electronic health records (EHR) has been acknowledged for bringing down healthcare costs and enhancing hospital service standards.   Aim:  The aim of this study was to develop an EHR model to lower patient treatment costs and enhance healthcare quality in South African public healthcare.   Methods:  In this study, a cross-sectional quantitative methodology was used. The research data for this study were provided by medical healthcare professionals, at Dr. George Mukhari Academic Hospital (DGMAH). This included doctors, nurses, pharmacists, radiologists, and radiographers who completed a semi-structured questionnaire.   Results:  The final model’s findings show that the use of EHR significantly improves information quality (IQ) and positively influences medical errors reduction (MER). Knowledge quality (KQ) has a positive significant impact on MER, whereas IQ has a considerable negative impact on MER. Furthermore, cost reduction in patient treatment (CRPT) has a positive significant influence on MER.   Conclusion:  Patients obtain better medical care when medical professionals have access to complete and accurate information. Medical errors can be reduced or even prevented with the use of EHRs, which can lead to better patient outcomes.   Contribution:  The quality of patient care at South African public hospitals and in other developing countries can be enhanced by using this framework as a guide to reduce treatment costs.},

	abstract = {Background:  For healthcare institutions, proper documentation of the upkeep of patient medical records is imperative. In addition, without a record of the patient’s medical history, the doctors are unable to demonstrate that the treatment was delivered correctly.   Aim:  The primary objective of this research was to determine the influence of electronic health records (EHR) towards the adoption of evidence-based healthcare practice (EBHP) in South African public healthcare.   Methods:  The study used a quantitative methodology, and a self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data from 300 healthcare professionals. In all, 450 questionnaires were distributed, and of those, 150 were unfit for data analysis because of insufficient data, leaving a total of 300 responses. Data were analysed using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to identify latent constructs. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to assess the validity and reliability of these constructs. The appropriateness of the measurement model was then assessed using fit indices for a structural equation model.   Results:  The findings show EHR had a direct influence on information quality, medical error reduction, diagnosis and treatment of diseases as well as better coordination of patient’s care. In addition, the results show that EHR-based clinical decision support is crucial for practising evidence-based healthcare and plays a significant role in the quality of healthcare, particularly in the management of diseases and preventative care. As all requirements for validity and reliability (root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA] = 0.085, comparative fit index [CFI] = 0.956 and χ 2 / df  = 2.513) have been satisfied, the model is considered valid and reliable.   Conclusion:  When healthcare professions such as doctors and nurses accurately record patients’ medical histories, they are able to make successful medical decisions and prescribe medications based on the patients’ past and present medical histories. Electronic health records systems facilitate the easier and more efficient exchange of patient data between medical schools, research labs, specialists, pharmacies and other healthcare institutions. Furthermore, they provide medical professionals with resources and up-to-date information to help them deliver EBHP that can benefit patients by reducing or even eliminating medical errors.   Contribution:  The study contributes theoretically to the field of information systems by outlining a model that includes the variables that affect the adoption of EBHPs in public hospitals.},

	abstract = {Background
Particulate matter pollution (PM2.5) is a leading global health risk factor. We analyzed the spatiotemporal trends of diseases attributable to PM2.5 at global, regional, and national levels from 1990 to 2021.

Methods
Using data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 study, we assessed global, regional, and national deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) due to PM2.5, along with age-standardized mortality rates (ASMR) and age-standardized DALY rates (ASDR), categorized by age, sex, year, location, and disease type. We used average annual percentage change (AAPC) to illustrate trends from 1990 to 2021. Spearman correlation analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between the socio-demographic index (SDI) and age-standardized rates (ASRs) across 204 countries. Bayesian age-period-cohort (BAPC) analysis was used to project trends for 2022–2036.

Results
In 2021, PM2.5 exposure contributed to 7.83 million deaths and 231.51 million DALYs globally. The age-standardized rates decreased to 95.69 per 100,000 for deaths (AAPC = −2.12) and 2984.47 per 100,000 for DALYs (AAPC = −2.22), compared to 1990. Disease burdens related to PM2.5, as reflected by ASMR and ASDR, declined across SDI quintiles and GBD super regions from 1990 to 2021. The low SDI quintile had the highest disease burden (ASMR: 211.39, ASDR: 6,114.26). Correlation analysis revealed a significant negative relationship between ASRs and SDI. South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa experienced the highest disease burdens. Males had higher disease burdens than females globally and in all regions. The burden was particularly severe for children under five and older adults. Ischemic heart disease and stroke were the leading causes of PM2.5-related deaths and DALYs. Diabetes mellitus saw an increase in both deaths and DALYs. The BAPC model predicts continued declines in PM2.5-related ASDR and ASMR over the next 15 years.

Conclusion
With population growth and an aging demographic, the public health burden associated with PM2.5 exposure remains a major concern. It is imperative to develop targeted and proactive strategies that account for the unique circumstances and challenges of different regions.},

	abstract = {Background
Landfills are globally recognised as significant environmental and public health risks. Their emissions contribute to air and water contamination. However, research in the South African context remains limited.

Aim
To assess community perceptions of air quality and health impacts of living near a landfill site.

Setting
The study was conducted in Durban, South Africa.

Methods
The study employed a cross-sectional survey design. A structured survey questionnaire was used to collect data from a sample of residents (n = 154). Survey interviews were administered in English and isiZulu. Survey data were captured on Microsoft® Excel for descriptive statistical analysis.

Results
The analysis revealed that 72\% of respondents rated air quality as poor or very poor, with the landfill site identified as the primary contributor (77\%). Seasonal variations were evident, with summer perceived as the season of worst air quality (45\%). Awareness of environmental rights and engagement in formal environmental activities were low, with 93\% of respondents not participating in any environmental group. Common behavioural responses included shutting windows (60\%) and limiting outdoor activities (17\%), while 75\% of respondents advocated relocation of either the landfill site or the community to address these concerns.

Conclusion
The findings underscore the urgent need for stronger community engagement, targeted awareness campaigns and interventions to address environmental and health challenges near landfill sites.

Contribution
This study advances public health in Africa by highlighting the environmental and health risks of landfill sites and highlighting the need for targeted interventions in affected communities.},

	abstract = {Characterizing black carbon (BC) on a fine scale globally is essential for understanding its climate and health impacts. However, sparse BC mass measurements in different parts of the world and coarse model resolution have inhibited evaluation of global BC emission inventories. Here, we apply globally distributed BC mass measurements from the Surface Particulate Matter Network (SPARTAN) and complementary measurement networks to evaluate contemporary BC emission inventories. We use a global chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) in its high-performance configuration (GCHP) for high-resolution simulations to relate BC emissions to ambient concentrations for comparison with measurements. Here we find that simulations using the Community Emissions Data System (CEDS) emission inventory exhibit skill (r2 = 0.73) in representing variability in SPARTAN measurements across primarily developed regions with low BC concentrations but exhibit pronounced discrepancy (r2 = 0.00019) across high-BC regions in the Global South, underestimating BC by 38\%. Alternative inventories (EDGAR, HTAP) yield similar results. These findings motivate renewed attention to the challenging task of characterizing BC emissions from low- and middle-income countries., Using globally consistent measurements and high-resolution modelling, this study finds that black carbon emissions are generally underestimated in the Global South.},

	abstract = {The healthcare sector faces significant challenges in adopting big data analytics, primarily due to the complex interplay of various socio-technical factors that influence successful implementation. While prior research has identified numerous factors affecting big data analytics adoption, there is limited understanding of their relative importance in the healthcare context. This study aims to identify and prioritise the critical socio-technical factors influencing big data analytics adoption in healthcare through expert consensus. A four-round Delphi study was conducted with ten experts representing diverse stakeholders including academics, data scientists, healthcare practitioners, and top management. The study employed a comprehensive framework encompassing person, technology, organisation, environment, and task dimensions. The results revealed that analytical skills, knowledge, and experience were the most critical person-related factors. In the technology dimension, system reliability, and data quality emerged as top priorities, while organisational support, funding, and infrastructure were identified as crucial organisational factors. The study also highlighted technological advancement and government regulations as key environmental factors, with task reliability emerging as the most significant task-related factor. The study offers a comprehensive understanding of the relative importance of various social-technical factors, thereby enabling more focused and effective big data analytics adoption strategies in healthcare settings.},

	abstract = {Many important questions in health professions education require datasets that are built from several sources, in some cases using data collected for a different purpose. In building and maintaining these datasets, project leaders will need to make decisions about the data. While such decisions are often construed as technical, there are several normative concerns, such as who should have access, how the data will be used, how products resulting from the data will be shared, and how to ensure privacy of the individuals the data is about is respected, etc. Establishing a framework for data governance can help project leaders in avoiding problems, related to such matters, that could limit what can be learned from the data or that might put the project (or future projects) at risk. In this paper, we highlight several normative challenges to be addressed when determining a data governance framework. Drawing from lessons in global health, we illustrate three kinds of normative challenges for projects that rely on data from multiple sources or involved partnerships across institutions or jurisdictions: (1) legal and regulatory requirements, (2) consent, and (3) equitable sharing and fair distribution.},

Selected previous literature is discussed where relevant in tracing the origins of our current knowledge.
RECENT FINDINGS: Climate and weather have strong influences on the spatial and temporal distribution of air pollution concentrations. Emissions of ozone and PM2.5 precursors increase at higher ambient temperatures. The reactions that form ozone occur faster with greater sunlight and higher temperatures. Weather systems influence the movement and dispersion of air pollutants in the atmosphere through the action of winds, vertical mixing, and precipitation, all of which are likely to alter in a changing climate. Recent studies indicate that, holding anthropogenic air pollution emissions constant, ozone concentrations in populated regions will tend to increase in future climate scenarios. For the USA, the climate impact on ozone is most consistently seen in north-central and north-eastern states, with the potential for many thousands of additional ozone-related deaths. The sensitivity of anthropogenic PM2.5 to climate is more variable across studies and regions, owing to the varied nature of PM constituents, as well as to less complete characterization of PM reaction chemistry in available atmospheric models. However, PM emitted by wildland fires is likely to become an increasing health risk in many parts of the world as climate continues to change. The complex interactions between climate change and air quality imply that future policies to mitigate these twin challenges will benefit from greater coordination. Assessing the health implications of alternative policy approaches towards climate and pollution mitigation will be a critical area of future work.},

	abstract = {The innumerable impact of climate change is a global menace to human health. This paper conveys a comprehensive review of scientific literature to explore the relationship between climate change, air pollutants, and human health. The integral relationship between climate change and health is complex and has a significant impact on every facet of human life. The impact can either be direct (e.g., exposures due to extreme heat, storms, flooding, and air pollution) or indirect (e.g., displacement, food security, and variation in water). The rising temperature of the planet could lead to increasingly severe health impacts from climate change in the future. It is important to take stringent climate actions to mitigate the climate change risk and adapt to the impacts that are already happening. To lessen the speed and severity of climate change, mitigation focuses on cutting greenhouse gas emissions. Options for adaptation include things like advancing to higher ground to stop sea levels from increasing, growing new crops that can grow in a new environment, or using novel construction methods. Investing in novel or enhanced technology, infrastructure, and research is frequently required for adaptation. The review emphasized the importance of considering both short-term and long-term adaptation strategies as well as mitigation efforts, which call for steps to address the root cause by halting or reducing the growth in fossil fuel emissions that might severely and completely increase the earth's scorching temperatures. The results of this study provide insightful viewpoints on adaptation measures, and mitigation strategies for decision-makers, experts in public health, and researchers working in the field of climate change and its effects on human health.},

Reducing pollution at its source can have a rapid and substantial impact on health.

The interventions are cost-effective. Reducing factors causing air pollution and climate change have strong cobenefits. Although regions with high air pollution have the greatest potential for health benefits, health improvements continue to be associated with pollution decreases even below international standards. The large response to and short time needed for benefits of these interventions emphasize the urgency of improving global air quality and the importance of increasing efforts to reduce pollution at local levels.},

Consequently, the effects of breathing polluted air in large cities are being assessed for given risk groups and different indoor and outdoor activities. This work delves into the study of the possibility to develop individual portable air-purifying respirators to avoid the exposure to atmospheric pollution when carrying out common daily activities at home or outdoors. Samples of known concentrations of the criteria pollutants (except for lead) have been monitored before and after passing through a powered occupational respirator which has been also tested carrying out physical activities mainly under outdoor conditions. The results show that the system is not effective against carbon monoxide but it does provide protection against particulate matter, SO2, NOx, O3, and volatile organic compounds, that is, most of the main pollutants found in outdoor air. Thus, individual powered respirators are technologically viable based on the current occupational devices and by providing them with additional suggested improvements. Being affordable, this kind of systems may become very helpful not only for assistive applications but also for healthy people willing to reduce exposure to air pollution.},

Here we show how such sensors, deployed as a network, provide unprecedented insights into the patterns of pollutant emissions, in this case at London Heathrow Airport (LHR). Measurements from the sensor network were used to unequivocally distinguish airport emissions from long range transport, and then to infer emission indices from the various airport activities. These were used to constrain an air quality model (ADMS-Airport), creating a powerful predictive tool for modelling pollutant concentrations. For nitrogen dioxide (NO2), the results show that the non-airport component is the dominant fraction (∼75\%) of annual NO2 around the airport and that despite a predicted increase in airport related NO2 with an additional runway, improvements in road traffic fleet emissions are likely to more than offset this increase. This work focusses on London Heathrow Airport, but the sensor network approach we demonstrate has general applicability for a wide range of environmental monitoring studies and air pollution interventions.},

Many studies have revealed that the increased ambient air pollution caused by industrialization and urbanization is highly associated with morbidity and mortality worldwide. Air pollution encompasses a wide variety of pollutants, of which oxides of nitrogen (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), ozone (O3), particulate matter (PM), and lead (Pb) are of utmost concern. The development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is strongly associated with exposure to the fine PM content of air pollution. Based on strong epidemiological evidence, ischemic heart disease, arrhythmias, and heart failure are just some ramifications of exposure to air pollutants. With this concept in mind, this chapter aims to understand the relationship between exposure to different common air pollutants (PM, SO2, NO2, O3, Pb, and CO) and the occurrence of CVD. Different acute cardiac events, the impact of short-term and long-term exposure to air pollution, the pathophysiological processes underlying CVD, and future opportunities in this field are given particular attention.},

	abstract = {The research presented here is aimed at determining the burden of air pollution on society related to diagnosed cardiovascular disease (CVD). Inequalities in the burden of premature mortality and morbidity between economies with different levels of socioeconomic development were assessed. The number of years of premature life and health lost due to exposure to air pollution was used as a measure of the burden of the long-term effects of CVD on economies. Data from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation’s Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 were used in the analysis. The results show that the health burden of CVD due to air pollution varies widely around the world. The inequalities observed are particularly related to the relationship between economies with different levels of socioeconomic development. Based on an analysis of the process of convergence of the values analyzed over the period 1990–2019 in the group of EU-27 countries, the hypothesis of a persistently high level of inequalities was verified. No real effect of reducing inequalities in the level of the analyzed parameters was observed in the analysis of the potential catching-up process of the most disadvantaged EU countries (highest incidence of CVD s due to air pollution) with countries with lower incidence rates. The diagnosed differences indicate the existence of permanent and statistically significant differences in the area studied between the countries of the EU-14 group (countries of the “old” EU) and the countries of the EU-CEE group (countries of Central and Eastern Europe). The results obtained provide a new perspective for assessing the consequences of air pollution in developed economies, taking into account the level of burden of CVD effects.

	abstract = {The climate crisis is one of the main existential threats to pregnant health. Today, more than 3,000 substances that are not part of the composition are considered air pollutants. These pollutants may contain chemicals, such as lead (Pb), nitrogen oxide (NO), carbon monoxide (CO), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), volatile organic compounds (VOC), pesticides, microplastics (MP), nanoplastics (NPs), radionuclides, or biological materials (viruses and fungi), and are unlikely to cause long- or short-term negative effects such as low birth weight (LBW), preeclampsia, cardiovascular, and lung diseases during pregnancy. The effects of natural disasters such as radionuclides, desert sand, and dust storms are a multiplier of health threats that negatively affect pregnant and neonatal health. For example, the available evidence on the impact of dust episodes on pregnancy is very scarce despite their adverse effects on pregnancy, such as coccidioidomycosis. Despite interest in air pollutants, few studies have considered the effect of MPs and NPs during pregnancy, considering their various routes of polluting the air. Therefore, the absence of the effects of the aforementioned pollutants on pregnancy has encouraged us to conduct this research work. As a result, this chapter aims to discuss the main health challenges facing pregnant and newborn children, focusing on the most important routes of pollution for fetuses. This can lead to slow birth weight, reduced birth size, stillbirth, and delayed fetal growth. Furthermore, extreme weather conditions and their health effects on pregnancy will be briefly explained.},

Emerging from this first phasework is an anticipated suite of over 110 Air QualityManagement Areas (AQMAs). These areas are identifiedlocations where one or more of the national air qualityobjectives are predicted to exceed by specific target dates,and their spatial extent and shape is emerging as highlyvariable. Local authorities are guided to use a variety ofscientific tools to underpin the scientific assessments, anda consideration of uncertainty in both the tools used andsubsequent delineation of AQMAs is likely to affect theemerging management areas significantly. With subsidiarity underpinning the process of local air qualitymanagement (LAQM), local decision-making is anticipated toinfluence the outcome of the LAQM process in its entirety,with the declaration of AQMAs necessitating the preparationand implementation of air quality action plans. UKexperience of the effective management of local air quality,through the designation of AQMAs, demonstrates a valuableframework for other European countries developing mechanismsto manage air quality locally.},

Acne, hyperpigmentation, atopic dermatitis, and psoriasis have been shown to be influenced by air pollution. It is important for pollution to be added as a risk factor for these skin disorders, and thus we must discuss mitigating its negative affects with patients. Air pollution is the contamination of outdoor (ambient) and indoor (household) environments by any chemical, physical, or biological agent that modifies the natural characteristics of the atmosphere. Nearly all (90\%) of the world’s population experience daily pollution. In 2019, air pollution was considered by the World Health Organization to be the biggest environmental health risk to humans, responsible for killing more than 7 million people prematurely every year. Preliminary studies link air pollution to COVID-19 deaths, as there were high death tolls in some of the most globally polluted areas. Air pollution affects many organ systems such as cardiovascular, pulmonary, central nervous, reproductive, and integumentary systems. In this study, we detail the current evidence linking specific skin and health disorders to air pollution.},

Over the last 10 years, there has been a substantial increase in findings that particulate matter (PM) air pollution is not only exerting a greater impact on established health endpoints, but is also associated with a broader number of disease outcomes. Data strongly suggest that effects have no threshold within the studied range of ambient concentrations, can occur at levels close to PM2.5 background concentrations and that they follow a mostly linear concentration–response function. Having firmly established this significant public health problem, there has been an enormous effort to identify what it is in ambient PM that affects health and to understand the underlying biological basis of toxicity by identifying mechanistic pathways—information that in turn will inform policy makers how best to legislate for cleaner air. Another intervention in moving towards a healthier environment depends upon the achieving the right public attitude and behaviour by the use of optimal air pollution monitoring, forecasting and reporting that exploits increasingly sophisticated information systems. Improving air quality is a considerable but not an intractable challenge. Translating the correct scientific evidence into bold, realistic and effective policies undisputedly has the potential to reduce air pollution so that it no longer poses a damaging and costly toll on public health.},

	abstract = {Rapid urban population growth, air pollution emissions, and changing patterns of disease in African cities may increase the burden of air pollution-related morbidity and mortality in coming decades. Yet, air monitoring is limited across the continent and many countries lack air quality standards. This paper focuses on particulate matter (PM) pollution, one of the most relevant and widely used indicators of urban air quality. We provide an overview of published PM monitoring studies in Africa, outline major themes, point out data gaps, and discuss strategies for addressing particulate air pollution in rapidly growing African cities. Our review reveals that, although few studies have reported annual mean levels of coarse and fine particles, collective evidence from short- and long-term air monitoring studies across urban Africa demonstrates that pollution levels often exceed international guidelines. Furthermore, pollution levels may be rising as a result of increased motor vehicle traffic building on already high background concentrations of PM in many locations due to climatic and geographic conditions. Biomass burning and industrial activities, often located in cities, further exacerbate levels of PM. Despite the health risks this situation presents, air quality programs, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, have been stalled or discontinued in recent years. Implementation of systematic PM data collection would enable air pollution-related health impact assessments, the development of strategies to reduce the air pollution health burden, and facilitate urban planning and transportation policy as it relates to air quality and health.},

	abstract = {Social economists and environmental researchers all over the globe are involved in how socioeconomic aspects and ambient air effluence affect the health of people. Despite wide research studies, the spatial heterogeneity consequences on public health remain poorly understood. Many emerging nations and the global world as a whole are becoming increasingly interested in the issue of environmental contamination. Inadvertently causing significant environmental issues, the recent rapid urbanization and industrialization that have been observed throughout the world have contributed to expanding socioeconomic developments that have resulted in the overexploitation of natural resources. This chapter is an effort to outline the socioeconomic effects of environmental contamination on our outdoor environment. In particular, we concentrated further on the main types of contamination that are extensively acknowledged as global public health issues, such as air pollution, counting its effects and how it has acted as a barrier to social and economic progress by placing great strain on resources and the environment. Several types of interventions together with potential means of guaranteeing environmental quality and sustainability that would benefit public health and well-being were recommended. Research on the socioeconomic state of urban air pollution and its causes is essential because it contributes to a better consideration of the mutual response mechanisms between socioeconomic systems and outdoor pollution. Understanding these processes can help in the creation and application of effective environmental regulations, which will ultimately enhance the standard of urbanization development.},

However, a call for more evidence should not put a pause on actions and future plans that will help reduce pollution emission and exposure to air pollutants as there are sufficient evidence to indicate that air pollutants impact health.},

	abstract = {Working on the relationship between respiratory health and atmospheric pollution in French cities led us to adopt a perspective that considers the risk for a single city of showing high levels of respiratory health problems. The risk level in a city is dependent on population vulnerability, the city context and pollutant levels. This presentation focuses on the observation of the unequal pollution hazards in French cities on a macro-scale. The study field covers 34 French cities of more than 100,000 inhabitants. The aim is to build comparable synthetic indicators of atmospheric pollution that consider the temporal and spatial diversity within a city, and to compare the different results. The focus is on the results for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) over the 2007 and 2008 winter season. The paper presents the database and methodology used. The findings show that the spatial structure of air pollution between the cities remains globally the same whatever the indicator chosen. However, the results also show significant changes in the relative position of certain cities. When comparing the more conventional indicator calculated from mean daily concentrations in urban monitoring sites with an indicator also taking into account the concentrations observed in roadside stations, relative changes appear for more than ten cites. These findings highlight the importance of the criteria used in the choice of the indicators, and the benefit of using a set of complementary indicators in epidemiological studies.},

In this umbrella review, we summarized the current epidemiological evidence from systematic reviews and meta‐analyses linking ambient air pollution and CVDs, with a focus on geographical differences and vulnerable subpopulations. We performed a search strategy through multiple databases including articles between 2010 and 31 January 2021. We performed a quality assessment and evaluated the strength of evidence. Of the 56 included reviews, the most studied outcomes were stroke (22 reviews), all‐cause CVD mortality, and morbidity (19). The strongest evidence was found between higher short‐ and long‐term ambient air pollution exposure and all‐cause CVD mortality and morbidity, stroke, blood pressure, and ischemic heart diseases (IHD). Short‐term exposures to particulate matter {\textless}2.5 μm (PM2.5), {\textless}10 μm (PM10), and nitrogen oxides (NO
x
) were consistently associated with increased risks of hypertension and triggering of myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke (fatal and nonfatal). Long‐term exposures of PM2.5 were largely associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis, incident MI, hypertension, and incident stroke and stroke mortality. Few reviews evaluated other CVD outcomes including arrhythmias, atrial fibrillation, or heart failure but they generally reported positive statistical associations. Stronger associations were found in Asian countries and vulnerable subpopulations, especially among the elderly, cardiac patients, and people with higher weight status. Consistent with experimental data, this comprehensive umbrella review found strong evidence that higher levels of ambient air pollution increase the risk of CVDs, especially all‐cause CVD mortality, stroke, and IHD. These results emphasize the importance of reducing the alarming levels of air pollution across the globe, especially in Asia, and among vulnerable subpopulations.,},

We also use data from the Ministry of Health to examine spatial and temporal patterns of acute respiratory infections, asthma, bronchitis, and tuberculosis across Senegal with an emphasis on Northern Hemisphere winter December–February, when air quality is poor, and June–August when there is an improvement in air quality. Measurements in Dakar, Senegal, suggest hazardous PM10 concentrations associated with Saharan dust storms but lower PM10 concentrations during the summer. The WRF dust simulations show a similar temporal pattern to the observations in Dakar, Senegal, with notable biases. However, the WRF model suggests that the highest dust concentrations are found across the northern half of Senegal during the winter season where there are no currently PM measurements. Health data during 2015–2016 show the highest prevalence of asthma and bronchitis in Dakar, Senegal, suggesting that other sources of air pollution are important. Acute respiratory infection is prevalent throughout the country with the high prevalence found in rural zones, for children between 12 and 59 months. All measures including real‐time monitoring, air quality forecast, and communication should be used to protect the public from potentially hazardous environmental conditions during the winter season.,

	abstract = {Traffic-related urban air pollution is a pressing concern in Tehran, Iran, with severe health implications. This study aimed to create a dynamic spatiotemporal model to predict changes in urban traffic-related air pollution in Tehran using a land use regression (LUR) model. Two datasets were employed to model the spatiotemporal distribution of gaseous traffic-related pollutants—sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and carbon monoxide (CO). The first dataset incorporated remote sensing data, including land surface temperature (LST), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), apparent thermal inertia (ATI), population density, altitude, land use, road density, road length, and distance to highways. The second dataset excluded remote sensing data, relying solely on population density, altitude, land use, road density, road length, and distance to highways. The LUR model was constructed using both datasets at three different buffer distances: 250, 500, and 1000 m. Evaluation based on the R2 index revealed that the 1000-m buffer distance achieved the highest accuracy. Without remote sensing data, R2 values for CO, NO2, and SO2 pollutants were respectively spring (0.77, 0.79, 0.51), summer (0.59, 0.71, 0.59), and winter (0.41, 0.52, 0.59). With remote sensing data, R2 values were respectively spring (0.82, 0.84, 0.74), summer (0.72, 0.87, 0.62), and winter (0.53, 0.59, 0.72). Incorporating remote sensing data notably improved the accuracy of modeling CO, NO2, and SO2 during all three seasons. The central, southern, and southeastern regions of Tehran consistently exhibited the highest pollutant concentrations throughout the year, while the northern areas maintained comparatively better air quality.},

Operational air quality forecasts for the Netherlands concerning ozone and PM10 are made available on the RIVM webpage (http://www.lml.rivm.nl/verw.html) and are used to warn the population in case of predicted exceedances of air quality standards. Lotos-Euros is also contributing to the model-ensemble based air quality forecasts for Europe (MACC project, http://macc-raq.gmes-atmosphere.eu/index.php?op=get). Currently, the system is expanded to assimilate routine surface observations from European networks as well as satellite observations such as OMI NO2. The Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) is a Dutch-Finnish instrument on the NASA EOS-Aura mission, and has a capability to detect boundary-layer NO2 with a unique resolution of about 20 km. The assimilation in Lotos-Euros is based on the ensemble Kalman filter technique in which model parameters such as the NOx emissions, VOC emissions, PM sources, ozone boundary conditions and/or deposition velocities are adjusted to improve the comparison with the observations. In our contribution we will discuss the experiences with the assimilation of NO2 tropospheric columns from the OMI instrument. In particular we will focus on the model-OMI comparisons over Europe, the analysis improvements, the analysed emissions and the impact of OMI NO2 data assimilation on other constituents such as ozone.},

	abstract = {Intermittent irregular sources of air pollution, when used in dispersion modeling, can exaggerate the acute health risk due to improbable coincidence of release with the worst-case meteorological conditions. This problem is alleviated by randomizing the moments of emission and applying the Monte Carlo method to obtain the realistic expected yearly maxima of hourly concentrations/risks. Emissions are modeled as irregular “pulses,” possibly with additional constraints on timing. Such are major emission sources in important industries: oil refineries, gas extraction, cement production, etc. We have tested the approach in {\textasciitilde}100 projects for industrial plants in Russia and obtained considerable reductions in estimated acute health risks: up to two orders of magnitude, depending on the level of intermittency of sources. These corrections to unrealistically high worst-case concentration values at nearby populated areas are, in many cases, a key to obtaining reasonable exclusion/protection zones for plants. To our knowledge, such a body of results on intermittent irregular sources is unique, and it can be useful especially for developing countries where the exact timeline of emissions is often unknown. Taking intermittency into account is also known to be an important step toward compliance with 1-h US National Ambient Air Quality Standard. We provide a detailed description of the Monte Carlo algorithm used. We compare Monte Carlo with the usual quantile-based approach to peak values; they agree when quantile is dependent on intermittency. The non-linearity of maximum function gives rise to some counterintuitive phenomena, which call for refinement of risk definition for intermittent irregular sources.},

	abstract = {Short-term exposure to air pollutants may contribute to an increased risk of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). This study assessed the role of short-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) as well as fine and coarse PM (PM10) air pollution in ACS events and the effect of blood groups on this phenomenon. A retrospectively collected database of 9026 patients was evaluated. The study design was a case-crossover using a conditional logistic regression model. The main analysis focused on PM2.5 levels with a 1 day lag until the ACS event, using threshold-modelled predictor for all patients. Secondary analyses utilized separate threshold-modelled predictors for 2–7-days moving averages and for patients from specific ABO blood groups. Additional analysis was performed with the non-threshold models and for PM10 levels. Short-term exposure to increased PM2.5 and PM10 levels at a 1-day lag was associated with elevated risks of ACS (PM2.5: OR = 1.012 per + 10 µg/m3, 95\% CI 1.003, 1.021; PM10: OR = 1.014 per + 10 µg/m3, CI 1.002, 1.025) for all patients. Analysis showed that exposure to PM2.5 was associated with increased risk of ACS at a 1-day lag for the A, B or AB group (OR = 1.012 per + 10 µg/m3, CI 1.001, 1.024), but not O group (OR = 1.011 per + 10 µg/m3, CI 0.994, 1.029). Additional analysis showed positive associations between exposure to PM10 and risk of ACS, with 7-days moving average models stratified by blood group revealing that exposures to PM2.5 and PM10 were associated with elevated risk of ACS for patients with group O. Short-term exposures to PM2.5 and PM10 were associated with elevated risk of ACS. Short-term exposure to PM2.5 was positively associated with the risk of ACS for patients with A, B, or AB blood groups for a 1-day lag, while risk in O group was delayed to 7 days.},

	abstract = {Exposure to air pollutants has been linked to the exacerbation of the respiratory disease. The air quality index and air quality health index (AQHI) were used to evaluate the number of asthma hospitalization attributed to air quality using time-series regression analysis with a distributed lag model. This study was performed from March 2014 to February 2019 in Hamadan, Iran. A generalized linear model (GLM) and distributed lag model (DLM) with the family of Poisson distribution were used to investigate the asthma hospitalization associated with air pollution. The seasonal effect of air pollution was considered in data analysis. Results showed that during the study period, 671 people were hospitalized. The mean (SD) values for AQI, AQHI, and PM2.5 levels were 70.66 (37.77), 3.58 (2.22), and 38.59 (17.43), respectively. The highest adverse effects on asthma hospitalization were observed for AQHI at lag 1 (RR = 1.052, 95\% CI 0.998–1.109) and for AQI at lag 1 (RR = 1.002, 95\% CI 0.997–1.007), for 1-unit increase of the indexes, and were observed for PM2.5 at lag 0 (RR = 1.005, 95\% CI 1.001–1.009) and lag 7 (RR = 1.005, 95\% CI 1.001–1.009) for 10 µg/m3 increase in PM2.5 levels. Seasonal analysis results showed that hospitalization in the warm season was significantly higher than that of the cold season for AQI and PM2.5 levels, while RR obtained for AQHI was higher in the cold season. The results confirm the association between air pollutants and an increase in a load of adult asthma hospitalization. To confirm the effects of seasonal variation of PM level and other possible factors (such as meteorological factors) on hospitalization due to asthma, more research will be needed. Our findings provide valuable data to increasing policymakers’ awareness and developing a strategy to improve air quality.},

	abstract = {Background Although 1 billion people live in informal (slum) settlements, the consequences for respiratory health of living in these settlements remain largely unknown. This study investigated whether children living in an informal settlement in Nairobi, Kenya are at increased risk of asthma symptoms.
Methods Children attending schools in Mukuru (an informal settlement in Nairobi) and a more affluent area (Buruburu) were compared. Questionnaires quantified respiratory symptoms and environmental exposures; spirometry was performed; personal exposure to particulate matter (PM2.5) was estimated.
Results 2373 children participated, 1277 in Mukuru (median age, IQR 11, 9–13 years, 53\% girls), and 1096 in Buruburu (10, 8–12 years, 52\% girls). Mukuru schoolchildren were from less affluent homes, had greater exposure to pollution sources and PM2.5. When compared with Buruburu schoolchildren, Mukuru schoolchildren had a greater prevalence of symptoms, ‘current wheeze’ (9.5\% vs 6.4\%, p=0.007) and ‘trouble breathing’ (16.3\% vs 12.6\%, p=0.01), and these symptoms were more severe and problematic. Diagnosed asthma was more common in Buruburu (2.8\% vs 1.2\%, p=0.004). Spirometry did not differ between Mukuru and Buruburu. Regardless of community, significant adverse associations were observed with self-reported exposure to ‘vapours, dusts, gases, fumes’, mosquito coil burning, adult smoker(s) in the home, refuse burning near homes and residential proximity to roads.
Conclusion Children living in informal settlements are more likely to develop wheezing symptoms consistent with asthma that are more severe but less likely to be diagnosed as asthma. Self-reported but not objectively measured air pollution exposure was associated with increased risk of asthma symptoms.},

	abstract = {Two of every three persons living with dementia reside in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs). The projected increase in global dementia rates is expected to affect LMICs disproportionately. However, the majority of global dementia care costs occur in high‐income countries (HICs), with dementia research predominantly focusing on HICs. This imbalance necessitates LMIC‐focused research to ensure that characterization of dementia accurately reflects the involvement and specificities of diverse populations. Development of effective preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic approaches for dementia in LMICs requires targeted, personalized, and harmonized efforts. Our article represents timely discussions at the 2022 Symposium on Dementia and Brain Aging in LMICs that identified the foremost opportunities to advance dementia research, differential diagnosis, use of neuropsychometric tools, awareness, and treatment options. We highlight key topics discussed at the meeting and provide future recommendations to foster a more equitable landscape for dementia prevention, diagnosis, care, policy, and management in LMICs.},

Leveraging data science could significantly advance the understanding of the health impacts of climate change and air pollution to meet health systems’ needs and improve public health in Africa. This scoping review will aim to identify and synthesise evidence on the use of data science as an intervention to address climate change and air pollution-related health challenges in Africa.

Methods and analysis
The search strategy will be developed, and the search will be conducted in the Web of Science, Scopus, CAB Abstracts, MEDLINE and EMBASE electronic databases. We will also search the reference lists of eligible articles for additional records. We will screen titles, technical reports, abstracts and full texts and select studies reporting the use of data science in relation to the health effects and interventions associated with climate change and air pollution in Africa.

Ethics and dissemination
There are no formal ethics requirements as we are not collecting primary data. Results, once published, will be disseminated via conferences and shared with policy-makers and public health, air pollution and climate change key stakeholders in Africa.},

	abstract = {Background:
Continuous ambient air quality monitoring in Kenya has been limited, resulting in a sparse data base on the health impacts of air pollution for the country. We have operated a centrally located monitor in Nairobi for measuring fine particulate matter (PM2.5), the pollutant that has demonstrated impact on health. Here, we describe the temporal levels and trends in PM2.5 data for Nairobi and evaluate associated health implications.

Methods:
We used a centrally located reference sensor, the beta attenuation monitor (BAM-1022), to measure hourly PM2.5 concentrations over a 3-year period (21 August 2019 to 20 August 2022). We used, at minimum, 75\% of the daily hourly concentration to represent the 24-hour concentrations for a given calendar day. To estimate the deaths attributable to air pollution, we used the World Health Organization (WHO) AirQ+ tool with input as PM2.5 concentration data, local mortality statistics, and population sizes.

Results:
The daily (24-hour) mean (±SEM) PM2.5 concentration was 19. 2 ± 0.6 (µg/m3). Pollutant levels were lowest at 03:00 and, peaked at 20:00. Sundays had the lowest daily concentrations, which increased on Mondays and remained high through Saturdays. By season, the pollutant concentrations were lowest in April and highest in August. The mean annual concentration was 18.4 ± 7.1 (µg/m3), which was estimated to lead to between 400 and 1,400 premature deaths of the city’s population in 2021 hence contributing 5\%–8\% of the 17,432 adult deaths excluding accidents when referenced to WHO recommended 2021 air quality guideline for annual thresholds of 5 µg/m3.

Conclusion:
Fine particulate matter air pollution in Nairobi showed daily, day-of-week, and seasonal fluctuations consistent with the anthropogenic source mix, particularly from motor vehicles. The long-term population exposure to PM2.5 was 3.7 times higher than the WHO annual guideline of 5 µg/m3 and estimated to lead to a substantial burden of attributable deaths. An updated regulation targeting measures to reduce vehicular emissions is recommended.},

	abstract = {Climate change is expected to profoundly impact health and coping and widen social and environmental inequalities. People living in informal settlements are especially vulnerable to climate change as they are often located in ecologically sensitive areas more susceptible to extreme weather events (EWEs), such as floods, droughts, and heat waves. Women residing in informal settlements are especially vulnerable to climate change and related EWEs because they are more likely to experience worse health-related impacts than men but are less likely to have access to health-related services. Despite this inequality, there is a dearth of research that focuses on the impacts of EWEs on women in informal settlements. This study aims to explore the multidimensional impacts of EWEs on the daily lives of women in informal settlements through the lens of socio-ecological theory. Study data is from six monthly surveys (1 September 2022-28 February 2023) collected from a probability sample of 800 women living in two of the largest informal settlements in Nairobi, Kenya. This data is part of an ongoing longitudinal study that uses community participatory methods to investigate the effects of climate change on health and well-being in informal settlements by a team of 16 community health volunteers who lead data collection and provide expertise in ongoing analysis. Findings show profound impacts on women's health and well-being across individual, micro-, meso-, exo-, and macrosystems. These include physical and mental health, financial disruptions, property issues, social impacts, and impacts on their surrounding physical environment, such as disrupted food or water access, poor air quality, drainage issues, and safety concerns. In addition, findings highlight the critical importance of the chrono-and biosphere systems in research focused on the impacts of climate change and related EWEs among climate-vulnerable communities and marginalized populations within them.},

	abstract = {Air pollution is a critical global public health and environmental concern, leading to over 6.7 million premature deaths annually, disproportionately affecting low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where the use of polluting fuels for cooking remains widespread. Incorporating perceptions of air pollution is argued as vital for developing effective intervention strategies. However, this has seldom been given focus in the development of clean cooking interventions. The use of firewood in Kenyan schools is commonplace and the transition to clean cooking methods in school settings is gaining international attention. We investigated how air pollution is perceived and understood by staff in three schools from an informal settlement in Nairobi, Kenya which predominately use firewood or charcoal for school catering. We conducted focus group discussions and in-depth interviews and used thematic analysis to explore perceptions of air pollution in the schools and how these differed between different staff groups. Perceptions of air pollution were dominated by external environmental factors from the surrounding informal settlement. While the impacts of air pollution from firewood on catering staff and teaching activities were recognised, understandings of the long-term health impacts were often blurred and dislocated from the school setting. Responsibilities for addressing air pollution were said to be with external stakeholders, but the school staff cited a lack of government interventions to address underlying poverty and multiple pollution sources. Effective strategies to tackle air pollution must involve careful engagement with stakeholders and community members to incorporate local perceptions of air pollution and address broader systemic issues that increase exposure. Clean cooking interventions focused solely on reducing air pollution may face challenges due to competing financial demands and a tendency to shift responsibilities for tackling such an issue. Broader benefits, such as economic and environmental improvements, might be more compelling drivers for successful implementation.},

	abstract = {Introduction Worldwide, 2.4 billion people rely on solid fuels such as wood or charcoal for cooking, leading to approximately 3.2 million deaths per year from illnesses attributable to household air pollution. Across Africa, household air pollution generated by solid fuel use accounts for nearly 700,000 deaths each year. Most studies to date have focused either household air pollution exposure, its impacts on particular health outcomes or on the efficacy of mitigation interventions. However, the economic, social, and cultural determinants of household air pollution in Africa are still poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to explore people’s experience of using solid fuels for cooking in two informal settlements, Ndirande in Malawi and Mukuru in Kenya, and the associated harms caused by household air pollution. Methods We adopted a community-based participatory method, photovoice, which was conducted with 9 participants in Ndirande and 10 participants in Mukuru. Participants took pictures reflecting their experiences and perceptions of household air pollution harms over a two-week period, and later discussed, sorted and analysed those in a series of meetings. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the data. Results With their pictures, participants described fuel stacking and switching behaviours in their communities. They described a mix of charcoal, firewood and other biomass fuels use. They also expressed their awareness and perceptions of the harms caused by smoke when cooking. Participants explained the simple behaviours used by residents to minimize the harms of household air pollution to themselves and within their own household. Other themes explored the roles and responsibilities for procuring fuels in the home, and the stated solutions required to address the issues and manage the transition to cleaner fuels in those informal settlements. Conclusion This study highlights not only the need to understand the daily life, priorities and concerns of those who use solid fuels on informal settlements, but also the urgency to place them and their experience at the heart of the solutions that will reduce the health harms of household air pollution.},

	abstract = {This article presents a case study of the design of an autonomous wireless sensor network for environmental monitoring to provide data for understanding the relationships among food, energy, and water systems in suburban areas in Long Island New York. The study focuses on the existing water quality data for the two counties on Long Island, Nassau and Suffolk Counties, to understand the impact of energy and food production on the coastal waters of Long Island Sound and Peconic Bay. The analysis of existing data from the US Environmental Protection Agency database reveals the challenges in using such data to understand the relationships between water quality, weather events and identified point sources of pollutants. Maintaining on-going data collection programs is expensive, time-consuming and personnel intensive which is why this project examines new ways to obtain and utilize environmental data. The researchers propose the design of an autonomous wireless sensor network environmental monitoring system with an optimal sensor placement strategy to identify targeted locations for water quality monitoring. The goal is to provide environmental data that can facilitate a better understanding of the interactions of farming activities and energy production resulting in undesirable impacts on water quality. The proposed design can be used to provide real-time data to help stakeholders improve efficiency in resource management and advance early detection of potential hazardous events. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 37: 180–188, 2018},

	abstract = {Equity is an important criterion in evaluating health system performance. Developing a framework for equitable and effective resource allocation for health depends upon knowledge of service providers and their location in relation to the population they should serve. The last available map of health service providers in Kenya was developed in 1959. We have built a health service provider database from a variety of traditional government and opportunistic non-government sources and positioned spatially these facilities using global positioning systems, hand-drawn maps, topographical maps and other sources. Of 6674 identified service providers, 3355 (50\%) were private sector, employer-provided or specialist facilities and only 39\% were registered in the Kenyan Ministry of Health database during 2001. Of 3319 public service facilities supported by the Ministry of Health, missions, not-for-profit organizations and local authorities, 84\% were registered on a Ministry of Health database and we were able to acquire co-ordinates for 92\% of these. The ratio of public health services to population changed from 1:26,000 in 1959 to 1:9300 in 1999–2002. There were 82\% of the population within 5km of a public health facility and resident in 20\% of the country. Our efforts to recreate a comprehensive, spatially defined list of health service providers has identified a number of weaknesses in existing national health management information systems, which with an increased commitment and minimal costs can be redressed. This will enable geographic information systems to exploit more fully facility-based morbidity data, population distribution and health access models to target resources and monitor the ability of health sector reforms to achieve equity in service provision.},

We carried out an exploratory assessment of the health information system in Kenya with the main objective of determining the quality of data in terms of accuracy, timeliness and completeness. The study also considered the reasons for the observed data quality status. Data quality audits were carried out in selected health facilities. Data from the source documents at health facilities were compared to the data in the national health information systems for the same period.  Key informant interviews were conducted and focus group discussions conducted during quarterly review meetings at regional levels. The study revealed that the completeness rate for the monthly reports was 86.9 percent while the timeliness of the reports was 78.7 percent. In terms of accuracy of the reports, the study showed that while there was a significant amount of low accuracy in many reports evaluated, there was a surprisingly high accuracy of reports coming from the maternity units of all health facilities visited. The accuracy of the number of deliveries could be associated with the financial incentives provided by the government to health facilities as part of the countryâ€™s free maternity care project in which mothers deliver free of charge in health facilities. While most health information systems are plagued with poor data quality, a simple and practical incentive can improve accuracy, timeliness and completeness.},

	abstract = {Kenya has a population of approximately 44 million people. Health services are provided through a network of over 4,700 health facilities countrywide, with the public sector ac-counting for about 51\% of these facilities. The best quality of care is found at the national referral hospitals, which provide diagnostic, therapeutic and rehabilitative services. Kenya spent 5.1\% of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on healthcare in 2002. Life expectancy is also on the decline. In 2006, the child mortality rate was 78 per 1,000 live births. Among the Kenyans who are ill and choose to seek care, 44\% were hindered by cost and corruption. Another 18\% were hindered by the long distance to the nearest health facility. Basic primary care is provided at primary healthcare centers and dispensaries. The purpose of this paper is to create awareness of the current healthcare system in Kenya, its accessibility and enlighten on storage healthcare records. The research questions were:  What is the current situation on healthcare accessibility in Kenya? What are the benefits of introducing a computer -based system in the Kenyan health sector?  The results give a clear picture and what the healthcare system in Kenya operates and how the accessibility of healthcare facilities is experienced by the Kenyans. Some Kenyans are unable to access healthcare services due to various reasons. One of them is the distance to the health centers in relation to transport and urgency for treatment. Another problem is the cost of healthcare especially in the rural areas where a good number of civilians are below poverty level. There are also the benefits that the healthcare system will gain from introducing a computerized method of medical record storage to better identify the patients and render better healthcare services.},

	abstract = {Information garnered from health information systems (HIS) is essential for monitoring health, and for evaluating and improving the delivery of health-care services and programs. Yet the collection, collation, compilation, analysis and reporting of health data in most developing countries is faced with major problems resulting in incomplete, inaccurate and untimely data which is not useful for health decision-making.  Increasingly there is growing demand for good quality health information from developing countries as a result of performance based resource allocation by donors. This has led to some initiatives in these countries to reform the existing paper-based systems through computerization.  Kenyaâ€™s development blueprint titled â€˜Vision 2030: First Medium Term Plan (2008-2012)â€™ identified the need to strengthen the national HIS to enable it provide timely and understandable information on health.  But assessments conducted in the country in the past revealed that despite rising demand for health information, the Kenya HIS was weak and poorly integrated.  Recognizing the critical role played by a functional HIS, the country initiated an overhaul of the existing system to replace it with the free and open-source web-based District Health Information Software (DHIS2).
This review study looks at the challenges of implementing HIS in developing countries, and how various countries are attempting to overcome these challenges through computerization.  In particular we examine the increasing use of the free and open source DHIS2 as the HIS solution for various developing countries and review the outcome of several cases where DHIS2 has been implemented in Africa.  Against this backdrop we address the potential of DHIS2 as a motivator for health data availability and use in Kenya. 
It is evident that the DHIS2 system has presented unprecedented potential for Kenya to move from the era of unreliable and fragmented HIS system to the more ideal situation of availability and use of quality health information for rational decision making.  However it is also apparent that implementation of a technically sound system like DHIS2 is not an end in itself in ensuring improved reporting and use of HIS data.  The need for acceptance and adequate support from the national and local authorities, and by all targeted users of this system cannot be overemphasized},

We have implemented a mother and child health registration system in the study areas of Kenya and Lao PDR to evaluate barriers to digitalization.

Quantitatively, we analyzed the quality of recorded data according to missing information by the logistic regression analysis. The qualitative analysis identified six themes related to digitalization: satisfaction with the system, mothers’ resistance, need for training, double work, working environment, and other resources. The quantitative analysis showed that data entry errors improved around 10\% to 80\% based on odds ratios in subsequent quarters compared to first quarter periods. The number of registration numbers was not significantly related to the data quality, but the motivation, including financial incentives among HCWs, was related to the registration behavior. Considering both analysis results, workload and motivation to maintain high performance were significant obstacles to implementing a digital health system. We recommend enhancing the scope and focus on human needs and satisfaction as a significant factor for digital system durability and sustainability.},

	abstract = {East Africa's air pollution levels are deteriorating due to anthropogenic and biomass burning emissions and unfavorable weather conditions. This study investigates the changes and influencing factors of air pollution in East Africa from 2001 to 2021. The study found that air pollution in the region is heterogeneous, with increasing trends observed in pollution hot spots (PHS) while it decreased in pollution cold spots (PCS). The analysis identified four major pollution periods: High Pollution period 1, Low Pollution period 1, High Pollution period 2, and Low Pollution period 2, which occur during Feb-Mar, Apr-May, Jun-Aug and Oct-Nov, respectively. The study also revealed that long range transport of pollutants to the study area is primarily influenced by distant sources from the eastern, western, southern, and northern part of the continent. The seasonal meteorological conditions, such as high sea level pressure in the upper latitudes, cold air masses from the northern hemisphere, dry vegetation, and a dry and less humid atmosphere from boreal winter, further impact the transport of pollutants. The concentrations of pollutants were found to be influenced by climate factors, such as temperature, precipitation, and wind patterns. The study identified different pollution patterns in different seasons, with some areas having minimal anthropogenic pollution due to high vegetation vigor and moderate precipitation. Using Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression and Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA), the study quantified the magnitude of spatial variation in air pollution. The OLS trends indicated that 66 \% of pixels exhibited decreasing trends while 34 \% showed increasing trends, and DFA results indicating that 36 \%, 15 \%, and 49 \% of pixels exhibited anti-persistence, random, and persistence in air pollution, respectively. Areas in the region experiencing increasing or decreasing trends in air pollution, which can be used to prioritize interventions and resources for improving air quality, were also highlighted. It also identifies the driving forces behind air pollution trends, such as anthropogenic or biomass burning, which can inform policy decisions aimed at reducing air pollution emissions from these sources. The findings on the persistence, reversibility, and variability of air pollution can inform the development of long-term policies for improving air quality and protecting public health.},

Citizen science approaches are gaining relevance in air quality monitoring thanks to the advancement in environmental monitoring technology and the opportunities created for community-based organizations to collect data on air pollution through low-cost sensors. Fourteen households located in proximity to the Missing Link\#12 were equipped with optical particle sensors. Data collected indicated that people living along the road are exposed to levels of PM2.5 and PM10 above WHO recommendations, mainly due to the particulate generated by the construction site and fuels used for indoor cooking. A community engagement workshop revealed that participatory approaches are useful for improving awareness of air pollution and associated health implications. It also allowed the community to enhance their capability to gain and use scientific tools to address local issues, and potentially lobby decision-makers to solve them. In the context of transport infrastructure development in African cities, such an approach can be a means of collecting data and monitoring the impacts of air pollution during and after road building.},

With few air quality monitoring systems available, this study provides much needed high temporal resolution data to investigate the concentrations of particulate matter (PM) air pollution in Kenya. Calibrated low-cost optical particle counters (OPCs) were deployed in Kenya in three locations: two in the capital Nairobi and one in a rural location in the outskirts of Nanyuki, which is upwind of Nairobi. The two Nairobi sites consist of an urban background site and a roadside site. The instruments were composed of an AlphaSense OPC-N2 ran with a Raspberry Pi low-cost microcomputer, packaged in a weather-proof box. Measurements were conducted over a 2-month period (February–March 2017) with an intensive study period when all measurements were active at all sites lasting 2 weeks. When collocated, the three OPC-N2 instruments demonstrated good inter-instrument precision with a coefficient of variance of 8.8±2.0\&thinsp;\% in the fine particle fraction (PM2.5). The low-cost sensors had an absolute PM mass concentration calibration using a collocated gravimetric measurement at the urban background site in Nairobi.

The mean daily PM1 mass concentration measured at the urban roadside, urban background and rural background sites were 23.9, 16.1 and 8.8\&thinsp;µg\&thinsp;m−3, respectively. The mean daily PM2.5 mass concentration measured at the urban roadside, urban background and rural background sites were 36.6, 24.8 and 13.0\&thinsp;µg\&thinsp;m−3, respectively. The mean daily PM10 mass concentration measured at the urban roadside, urban background and rural background sites were 93.7, 53.0 and 19.5\&thinsp;µg\&thinsp;m−3, respectively. The urban measurements in Nairobi showed that PM concentrations regularly exceed WHO guidelines in both the PM10 and PM2.5 size ranges. Following a Lenschow-type approach we can estimate the urban and roadside increments that are applicable to Nairobi (Lenschow et al., 2001). The median urban increment is 33.1\&thinsp;µg\&thinsp;m−3 and the median roadside increment is 43.3\&thinsp;µg\&thinsp;m−3 for PM2.5. For PM1, the median urban increment is 4.7\&thinsp;µg\&thinsp;m−3 and the median roadside increment is 12.6\&thinsp;µg\&thinsp;m−3. These increments highlight the importance of both the urban and roadside increments to urban air pollution in Nairobi.

A clear diurnal behaviour in PM mass concentration was observed at both urban sites, which peaks during the morning and evening Nairobi rush hours; this was consistent with the high roadside increment indicating that vehicular traffic is a dominant source of PM in the city, accounting for approximately 48.1\&thinsp;\%, 47.5\&thinsp;\% and 57.2\&thinsp;\% of the total PM loading in the PM10, PM2.5 and PM1 size ranges, respectively. Collocated meteorological measurements at the urban sites were collected, allowing for an understanding of the location of major sources of particulate matter at the two sites. The potential problems of using low-cost sensors for PM measurement without gravimetric calibration available at all sites are discussed.

This study shows that calibrated low-cost sensors can be successfully used to measure air pollution in cities like Nairobi. It demonstrates that low-cost sensors could be used to create an affordable and reliable network to monitor air quality in cities.},

	abstract = {Background: 
          Continuous ambient air quality monitoring in Kenya has been limited, resulting in a sparse data base on the health impacts of air pollution for the country. We have operated a centrally located monitor in Nairobi for measuring fine particulate matter (PM2.5), the pollutant that has demonstrated impact on health. Here, we describe the temporal levels and trends in PM2.5 data for Nairobi and evaluate associated health implications.
          Methods: 
          We used a centrally located reference sensor, the beta attenuation monitor (BAM-1022), to measure hourly PM2.5 concentrations over a 3-year period (21 August 2019 to 20 August 2022). We used, at minimum, 75\% of the daily hourly concentration to represent the 24-hour concentrations for a given calendar day. To estimate the deaths attributable to air pollution, we used the World Health Organization (WHO) AirQ+ tool with input as PM2.5 concentration data, local mortality statistics, and population sizes.
          Results: 
          The daily (24-hour) mean (±SEM) PM2.5 concentration was 19. 2 ± 0.6 (µg/m3). Pollutant levels were lowest at 03:00 and, peaked at 20:00. Sundays had the lowest daily concentrations, which increased on Mondays and remained high through Saturdays. By season, the pollutant concentrations were lowest in April and highest in August. The mean annual concentration was 18.4 ± 7.1 (µg/m3), which was estimated to lead to between 400 and 1,400 premature deaths of the city’s population in 2021 hence contributing 5\%–8\% of the 17,432 adult deaths excluding accidents when referenced to WHO recommended 2021 air quality guideline for annual thresholds of 5 µg/m3.
          Conclusion: 
          Fine particulate matter air pollution in Nairobi showed daily, day-of-week, and seasonal fluctuations consistent with the anthropogenic source mix, particularly from motor vehicles. The long-term population exposure to PM2.5 was 3.7 times higher than the WHO annual guideline of 5 µg/m3 and estimated to lead to a substantial burden of attributable deaths. An updated regulation targeting measures to reduce vehicular emissions is recommended.},

Reduced life expectancy, as well as hospitalization for cardiorespiratory effects, and exacerbation of diseases such as asthma and COPD. Export processing zones (EPZ) employ large number of workers who engage in manufacturing of goods. Apparel processing is a key economic activity in EPZ. Garment cutting and stitching contribute to release of fine particles. This study aimed at assessing exposure to PM2.5 among workers in apparel processing companies in EPZ, Machakos County Kenya. The study utilized a cross-sectional descriptive design. Four apparel manufacturing factories were selected. Concentrations of PM2.5 were measured using a potable real time PM detector model, Turnkey Osiris Airborne Particulate Monitor with an accuracy of 0.1 μg/m3. The mean value for PM2.5 was 65.61 ± 31.5 with a range of 59.08 - 72.14 μg/m3. Main PM2.5 sources were found to be from Sewing/Embroidery {\textgreater} Cutting/Fusing/pres- sing {\textgreater} Fabric/relaxing/spreading {\textgreater} Packaging {\textgreater} Office departments respectively. The mean concentrations were above the WHO acceptable levels of 15 μg·m-3 for 24-hour exposure. The study reveals that there are significant PM2.5particles in apparel processing companies EPZ, Machakos County. The management should explore engineering control measures, occupational safety practices, and administrative controls to reduce respirable dust exposure.},

	abstract = {Nairobi County experiences rapid industrialization and urbanization that contributes to the deteriorating state of air quality, posing a potential health risk to its growing population. Currently, in Nairobi County, most air quality monitoring stations use low-cost, inaccurate monitors prone to defects. The study’s objective was to map Nairobi County’s air quality using freely available remotely sensed imagery. The Air Pollution Index (API) formula was used to characterize the air quality from cloud-free Landsat satellite images i.e., Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM+, and Landsat 8 OLI from Google Earth Engine. The API values were computed based on vegetation indices namely NDVI, TVI, DVI, and the SWIR1 and NIR bands on the QGIS platform. Qualitative accuracy assessment was done using sample points drawn from residential, industrial, green spaces, and traffic hotspot categories, based on a passive-random sampling technique. In this study, Landsat 5 API imagery for 2010 provided a reliable representation of local conditions but indicated significant pollution in green spaces, with recorded values ranging from -143 to 334. The study found that Landsat 7 API imagery in 2002 showed expected results with the range of values being -55 to 287, while Landsat 8 indicated high pollution levels in Nairobi. The results emphasized the importance of air quality factors in API calibration and the unmatched spatial coverage of satellite observations over ground-based monitoring techniques. The study recommends the recalibration of the API formula for characteristic regions, exploring newer satellite sensors like those onboard Landsat 9 and Sentinel 2, and involving key stakeholders in a discourse to develop a suitable Kenyan air quality index.},

The air quality big data is generally characterized by multi-source heterogeneity, dynamic mutability, and spatial–temporal correlation, which usually uses big data technology for air quality analysis after data fusion. In recent years, various models and algorithms using big data techniques have been proposed. To summarize these methodologies of air quality study, in this paper, we first classify air quality monitoring by big data techniques into three categories, consisting of the spatial model, temporal model and spatial–temporal model. Second, we summarize the typical methods by big data techniques that are needed in air quality forecasting into three folds, which are statistical forecasting model, deep neural network model, and hybrid model, presenting representative scenarios in some folds. Third, we analyze and compare some representative air pollution traceability methods in detail, classifying them into two categories: traditional model combined with big data techniques and data-driven model. Finally, we provide an outlook on the future of air quality analysis with some promising and challenging ideas.},

This paper develops and applies an integrated systemic approach to explore the state of air quality management in Nairobi, Kenya; as an LMIC exemplar city. The urban diagnostics approach developed assesses current particulate matter air pollution in Nairobi; quantifies anthropogenic emissions for the years 2015 and 2020 and projects scenarios of impacts of actions and inactions to 2030. This was combined with a review of grey literature on air quality policies, urban development and interviews with key stakeholders. The analysis suggests that commendable progress has been made to improve air quality in Nairobi but continuing hazardous levels of air pollution still require concerted policy efforts. Data available for numerical simulations have low spatial resolution and are generated from global emission inventories that can miss or misrepresent local emission sources. The current air quality data gap that needs to be addressed are highlighted. Strong political support is required to ensure that current air quality improvement approaches are evidence based to achieve long-term sustainability goals.},

	abstract = {East Africa's air pollution levels are deteriorating due to anthropogenic and biomass burning emissions and unfavorable weather conditions. This study investigates the changes and influencing factors of air pollution in East Africa from 2001 to 2021. The study found that air pollution in the region is heterogeneous, with increasing trends observed in pollution hot spots (PHS) while it decreased in pollution cold spots (PCS). The analysis identified four major pollution periods: High Pollution period 1, Low Pollution period 1, High Pollution period 2, and Low Pollution period 2, which occur during Feb-Mar, Apr-May, Jun-Aug and Oct-Nov, respectively. The study also revealed that long range transport of pollutants to the study area is primarily influenced by distant sources from the eastern, western, southern, and northern part of the continent. The seasonal meteorological conditions, such as high sea level pressure in the upper latitudes, cold air masses from the northern hemisphere, dry vegetation, and a dry and less humid atmosphere from boreal winter, further impact the transport of pollutants. The concentrations of pollutants were found to be influenced by climate factors, such as temperature, precipitation, and wind patterns. The study identified different pollution patterns in different seasons, with some areas having minimal anthropogenic pollution due to high vegetation vigor and moderate precipitation. Using Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression and Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA), the study quantified the magnitude of spatial variation in air pollution. The OLS trends indicated that 66 \% of pixels exhibited decreasing trends while 34 \% showed increasing trends, and DFA results indicating that 36 \%, 15 \%, and 49 \% of pixels exhibited anti-persistence, random, and persistence in air pollution, respectively. Areas in the region experiencing increasing or decreasing trends in air pollution, which can be used to prioritize interventions and resources for improving air quality, were also highlighted. It also identifies the driving forces behind air pollution trends, such as anthropogenic or biomass burning, which can inform policy decisions aimed at reducing air pollution emissions from these sources. The findings on the persistence, reversibility, and variability of air pollution can inform the development of long-term policies for improving air quality and protecting public health.},

	abstract = {South Africa remains an uncharted realm in terms of marine mobile emissions inventory and hence the impact of pollution from ships in coastal cities remains unknown. Such a void creates uncertainties about the extent of population exposure to pollution from ships, the health impact and economic value associated with the changes in policies for the port city of Durban. This study was aimed at estimating the health and economic impact of marine mobile emissions and the health and economic benefits associated with improvement in air quality within the port city of Durban, which is under eThekwini municipality. The population exposure to particulate matter of less than 2.5 and 10 μm (PM2.5 and PM10) and sulphur dioxide (SO2) from ships calling into Durban port were estimated using the AERMOD air dispersion model. The BenMAP modelling tool was then used to estimate the health impact and economic value of changes in emission of PM2.5, PM10 and SO2 from ships visiting Durban port. The reduction in emissions from ships was due to the reduction in the sulphur content of fuel from 3.5\% to 0.5\% that was implemented by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) on the 01st of January 2020. The results showed that PM2.5 and PM10 emissions reduced by 63\% in 2020 compared to 2018, whilst SO2 emissions reduced by 82\% over the same period. The BenMAP results indicated that 49 premature mortalities were avoided in 2020 compared to 2018 since the IMO's forced reduction in sulphur content of fuel by 85\% in 2020. These avoided cases on mortality were estimated a monetary value of R228 million using the World Bank’s 2016 estimates and R683 million using the USEPA Mean VSL estimate. Such monetary values were respectively equivalent to 0.05\% and 0.2\% of the eThekwini's GDP, which was estimated at R468 billion in 2016.},

They involve a public health investigation on a geographical scale (e.g. neighbourhood) with overlay of health, environmental, demographic and potential confounder data. Recent methodological advances, including Bayesian approaches, combined with fast-growing computational capabilities, permit more informative analyses than previously possible, including the incorporation of data at different scales, from satellites to individual-level survey information. Better data availability has widened the scope and utility of small-area studies, but has also led to greater complexity, including choice of optimal study area size and extent, duration of study periods, range of covariates and confounders to be considered and dealing with uncertainty. The availability of data from large, well-phenotyped cohorts such as UK Biobank enables the use of mixed-level study designs and the triangulation of evidence on environmental risks from small-area and individual-level studies, therefore improving causal inference, including use of linked biomarker and -omics data. As a result, there are now improved opportunities to investigate the impacts of environmental risk factors on human health, particularly for the surveillance and prevention of non-communicable diseases.},

We present new findings of two urban settlements located on the South African Highveld. Some of the mitigation measures include the enactment of National Ambient Air Quality Standards, Region-based Priority Air Quality Management Plans as well as Provincial Air Quality Management Plans. The above-mentioned mitigation approaches put in place by the South African government have designated priority regions which are characterized by high industrial emissions. The priority regions have been given precedence concerning intervention urgency from both the private and public sectors. Our chapter further recommends that to enhance a better understanding of air quality information and education in communities, there is a need to devise platforms which are easily accessible to community members. South Africa does have high cell phone penetration rates that would allow these technologies to be used as educational platforms. These platforms can be leveraged to educate communities on both indoor and ambient air pollution. At the moment, such an educational platform does not exist across South Africa except for the South African Air Quality Information Systems (SAAQIS), therefore the majority of community members are unaware of the sources of emissions and the human health and environmental impacts.},

Findings were that there has been a steady increase in the number of ambient air quality monitoring and management publications per year. Over the period under review, 2014 contributed 14 \% while 2020 contributed 27 \% of the total publications. Also, the study established that throughout the period South African scientist collaborated extensively with scientists from Finland, the United States of America, France, and Switzerland. Besides raising awareness levels in the field, the increase in studies can also assist policy formulation and development. In the meantime, the South African National government has also put in place several mitigation strategies to reduce emissions for example the enactment of ambient air quality guidelines.},

	abstract = {Air pollution remains one of the leading global environmental-health challenges the world is facing today, particularly within urban environments. amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, air pollution has been brought back into the spotlight as both attack the human respiratory systems. The purpose of the study was to investigate the quality of ambient air in a low-income urban settlement of Jabavu located within the City of Johannesburg during the year 2018. Air pollution and meteorological data were gathered from the South African Air Quality System network. The study focused on three pollutants namely PM10, SO2 and O3. Findings were that the seasonal ambient mean concentrations for PM10 in summer was (28.99 µg/m3), autumn (33.32 µg/m3), winter (61.71 µg/m3) and spring (48.44 µg/m3). On the other hand, the seasonal ambient mean concentrations for SO2 was summer (4.45ppb), autumn (3.19ppb), winter (5.65ppb) and spring (3.54ppb). The O3 seasonal ambient mean concentrations were summer (40.97ppb), autumn (21.01ppb), winter (15.90ppb) and spring (33.59ppb). Furthermore, the study observed that in summer, winter and spring the dominant long-range transport air masses originated from the South Atlantic Ocean, Madagascar Island-India Ocean and the Indian Ocean while in autumn the dominant air masses are short-range inland air masses. For SO2 and PM10, ambient concentrations were found to be more problematic during winter; while for O3 substantial levels were unexpectedly recorded in summer. When analysing the diurnal profiles of PM10, SO2 and O3, each of these pollutants revealed a unique distribution pattern, which, despite having seasonal variance, was consistent throughout the year. For instance, irrespective of the season, PM10 mostly peaked in the mornings and evenings; meanwhile SO2 and O3 often spiked during the midday and mid-afternoon, respectively. These findings indicate that air quality within this low-income settlement is poor. To improve air quality within low-income settlements there is a need for a shift from reliance on solid fuels to cleaner energy sources such as LP gas, biogas and solar accompanied by an increase in community awareness about air quality issues. This study contributes to knowledge building within the air quality monitoring scientific community while for policymakers it assists in policy formulation to enable air quality management.},

Due to globalization, the cause-effect between industrialization, economic growth and urbanization are changing. This study investigates the relationship between economic expansion, urbanization, and industrialization in Kenya using a quantitative methodology. Using World Bank economic indicator parameters, it focuses on understanding the complex interrelationships between these factors. Vector Autoregression (VAR) modeling is used to analyze the relationships between GDP, urbanization, and industrialization between 1990 and 2018. The Granger causality test is used to determine the causal linkages between GDP, urbanization, and industrialization. Results show that urbanization is increasing steadily across Kenya, with a high population in central, western, Rift valley, and coastal regions. The availability of agricultural land influences urbanization, with a significant positive relationship between the three parameters. The Granger causality test shows a unidirectional relationship between GDP, urbanization, and industrialization. A minimum of 20\% is considered as the benchmark for urbanization to reduce both GDP and industrialization. Unplanned and rapid urbanization, accompanied by ecologically unfavorable industrialization schemes, threatens Kenya's biodiversity. The study provides insight into the interconnection between the three pillars of the economy and the statistical models developed are useful in forecasting future trends.},

The chapter concludes with a reflection of factors that have shaped industrial development in Kenya. Like many developing countries, Kenya’s early years of independence pursued an import substitution strategy in which the government provided both direct support and tariff protection for the industrial sector. This strategy was a carryover from colonial policies, and its objectives were rapid growth of industry, reduced balance of payment pressure, more indigenous participation in the sector, and higher productivity and high-income employment. However, the import substitution policy failed to create much-needed employment and its high import content caused major balance of payment problems.},

We find that 302 cities lack emissions data, and the overall emission rate has been increasing at an average of 7.9\% per annum. Furthermore, only 31 cities have achieved reductions in the emissions gap, all of which are cities in the developed world. Even though cities are responsible for ∼75\% of global CO2 emissions, science lacks practical policies for mitigation where resources are scarce. Accordingly, we propose new policy directions to lessen this divide, and we urge the development of city-oriented mitigation science and practical policies to help cities around the world develop specific mitigation policies based on their economic feasibility.},

global pollutant that affects human and ecosystem
health. We synthesize understanding of sources, atmosphere-land-ocean
Hg dynamics and health effects, and consider the implications of Hg-control
policies. Primary anthropogenic Hg emissions greatly exceed natural
geogenic sources, resulting in increases in Hg reservoirs and subsequent
secondary Hg emissions that facilitate its global distribution. The
ultimate fate of emitted Hg is primarily recalcitrant soil pools and
deep ocean waters and sediments. Transfers of Hg emissions to largely
unavailable reservoirs occur over the time scale of centuries, and
are primarily mediated through atmospheric exchanges of wet/dry deposition
and evasion from vegetation, soil organic matter and ocean surfaces.
A key link between inorganic Hg inputs and exposure of humans and
wildlife is the net production of methylmercury, which occurs mainly
in reducing zones in freshwater, terrestrial, and coastal environments,
and the subsurface ocean. Elevated human exposure to methylmercury
primarily results from consumption of estuarine and marine fish. Developing
fetuses are most at risk from this neurotoxin but health effects of
highly exposed populations and wildlife are also a concern. Integration
of Hg science with national and international policy efforts is needed
to target efforts and evaluate efficacy.},

Currently, consistent methodologies to evaluate long-term mercury emissions across countries and industries are scant, hindering efforts to prioritize emission controls. Here, we develop a high-spatiotemporal-resolution dataset to comprehensively analyze global anthropogenic mercury emission patterns. We show that global emissions increased 330\% during 1960–2021, with declines in developed Global North countries since the 1990s and China since the 2010s completely offset by rapid growth in Global South countries (excluding China). Consequently, global emissions have continued to rise slightly since the 2013 Minamata Convention. In 2021, Global South countries produced two-thirds of global emissions, despite comprising only one-fifth of the global economy. We predict that, although large uncertainties exist, continued emission growth in Global South countries under a business-as-usual scenario could increase 10\%-50\% global mercury emissions by 2030. Our findings demonstrate that global control of anthropogenic mercury emissions has reached a critical juncture, highlighting the urgent need to target reductions in Global South countries to prevent worsening health and environmental impacts.},

METHODS: We compiled an inventory of ambient air quality standards for 194 countries worldwide for six air pollutants: PM2.5, PM10, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide. We conducted literature and internet searches and asked country representatives about national ambient air quality standards.
RESULTS: We found information on 170 countries including 57 countries that did not set any air quality standards. Levels varied greatly by country and by pollutant. Ambient air quality standards for PM2.5, PM10 and SO2 poorly complied with WHO guideline values. The agreement was higher for CO, SO2 (10-min averaging time) and NO2.
CONCLUSIONS: Regulatory differences mirror the differences in air quality and the related burden of disease around the globe. Governments worldwide should adopt science based air quality standards and clean air management plans to continuously improve air quality locally, nationally, and globally.},

Over the past 15 years, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and its partners invested substantial time and resources in developing the Environmental Benefits Mapping and Analysis Program – Community Edition (BenMAP–CE). BenMAP–CE is a publicly available, PC-based open source software program that can be configured to conduct health impact assessments to inform air quality policies anywhere in the world. The developers coded the platform in C\# and made the source code available in GitHub, with the goal of building a collaborative relationship with programmers with expertise in other environmental modeling programs. The team recently improved the BenMAP–CE user experience and incorporated new features, while also building a cadre of analysts and BenMAP–CE training instructors in Latin America and Southeast Asia.},

	abstract = {The maintenance problem and its technical and social causes Two major determinants for the widespread adoption of a tool are its usability and its maintenance over time [7,8]. The first case is perhaps the more obvious: tools that are difficult to install or use are often neglected by the community of life scientists who could most benefit from them. The second case is perhaps more overlooked, although no less important. Modern bioimage analysis methods are complex, and even the simplest software implementations may depend on dozens of other pieces of scientific software (typically referred to as dependencies). This intricate web of interdependent software packages is, regrettably, extremely brittle, and changes in any one dependency can cause significant changes to be required for existing software tools to continue working properly. Over time, the probability that unmaintained tools are able to still function in up-to-date environments becomes quickly smaller and smaller. Even worse, the time and technical knowledge required to update bioimage analysis software tools is enormous [9], and few people have the know-how to do so.In a perfect world, all software tools that find active users would be continuously maintained. Unfortunately, there are many reasons why even published software tools with an active user-base are not. Compared to publishing new methods and tools, the maintenance of existing tools typically does not provide much in terms of career advancement for the maintainer. At best, an existing publication might get cited more often, but the advantage of this pales in comparison with a new paper being published. Additionally, the person working on the maintenance of a software tool might not even be an author on the original publication, leaving this important work completely unrewarded by commonly used scientific performance indicators. Finally, maintaining software requires continuity of expertise, which is too easily lost when a main developer switches between labs or moves on to their next career stage. Incentive structures are therefore not aligned with the long-term commitment required to maintain open research software [10], leading to most tools being maintained only for a limited period of time [11].Another difficulty in maintaining existing software tools is that funding for this kind of work is rare. While there exist both public and private funding mechanisms to support open source projects in general, a recent EU analysis [12] found that the majority of this funding was dedicated to new projects, with comparatively little funding for long-term maintenance of existing ones. There are only a few notable exceptions we know of, where funding bodies have dedicated specific calls to software sustainability (e.g. the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative [13], the DFG [14] and BMBF (de.NBI), the Virtual Institute of Scientific Software [15], or the Software Sustainability Institute [16]). Still, such funding is currently not available at the level required to build user friendly and better maintained software tools [10].Currently, not only are we unable to achieve these important goals, we struggle even to keep our best research software engineers employed and offer them a stable career or adequate income. It is therefore not surprising that many of the software engineering activities in academia are carried out by personnel in limited-term positions, such as PhD students, post-docs, or young RSEs on short term staff positions. Since experienced RSEs are highly qualified experts that are also in high demand outside academia, we regularly see talented people leave to work in industry. This makes the previously discussed software maintenance dilemma even more problematic: once such developers run out of time or funding, development is halted, maintenance is abandoned, and the expertise in which the hosting group and institute has invested is lost.Could the existing academic technology transfer infrastructure be a solution for this problem? Instead of talented RSEs leaving to pursue a career in mainstream technology companies, they could be offered the chance to continue the development and maintenance of research software in the context of a newly incubated startup or spin-off company. There are successful examples, such as Cytomine [17] or KNIME [18], where this has worked, but also many other instances where it has not. The idea of useful software receiving funding by selling licenses is obvious and clean, however it unfortunately often fails due to some combination of the following reasons: (i) it is hard to find investors for open software, but closing the code base removes community engagement and slows development and interoperability, (ii) the existing codebase is released under a license that makes it hard to commercialize it, (iii) many users would rather switch to alternate software tools rather than pay money for licenses. The last point is critical: scientific analysis software is highly specialized and the number of users is, in absolute terms, limited. While some commercial software tools create value by enabling faster, more reproducible, more quantitative, and less biased academic research, the scientists and research groups in the user base may not have the money for software licenses. In addition, analyses performed in commercial software require other research groups to obtain similar licenses to replicate them, creating additional barriers to reproducibility and the dissemination of open science. We therefore believe that research software development should be supported by science funders and institutions.Despite the undeniable importance of software tools in life science research, being a research software engineer has not yet become a common career path. Individuals that do choose to become RSEs are likely to suffer from job insecurity and will in many cases earn well below equally skilled colleagues working in industry.But not all hope is lost. There are research groups and scientific institutes that are increasingly investing in their RSEs (a very incomplete set of examples are LOCI at the University of Wisconsin, the EMBL in Heidelberg or Hinxton, the MPI-CBG in Dresden, the Allen Institute in Seattle, or the Human Technopole in Italy).We believe that institutes and funding agencies have the power to elevate the usability and sustainability of bioimage analysis software by providing better career opportunities for RSEs. Such change would have a profound impact on the rate of scientific progress even beyond the field of bioimage analysis. More concretely, we postulate that image analysis facilities (or image analysis teams within imaging facilities) are an ideal place for RSEs to conduct their work and foster this potential.Historically, bioimage analysis has often found fertile ground within imaging facilities, which have naturally been the first to see how important and tightly coupled adequate analysis methods and workflows are to the microscopy work conducted in those facilities. More recently this has led to increased hiring of skilled bioimage analysts in such facilities and even to the creation of dedicated core facilities focused on image analysis (examples can be found, among other places, at Institut Pasteur [19], Institut Curie [20], EMBL Heidelberg [21], Human Technopole [22], or the TU-Dresden [23]).Key performance indicators (KPI) of image analysis facilities or image analysis teams within imaging facilities are typically metrics like (i) the number of interactions with users, (ii) the level of satisfaction those users report, (iii) the number of completed analysis projects, or (iv) the tally of co-authorships or other acknowledgements in resulting publications. The imperative to demonstrate usefulness using such KPIs can, however, leave little space for research software engineering activities. As a consequence, efforts spent on developing new methods and approaches remain circumscribed to the needs of the facility\&\#39;s own users and too rarely impact users more globally. It is up to individual bioimage analysts to devote the extra time required to package an analysis pipeline into a useful tool and release it to the public. There exist examples of methods that were successfully translated into more generally available and popular software tools, such as Trackmate [24,25], MoBIE [26], Labkit [27], CellPose [28], and others, which are broadly used in life-science research. Despite this success, these tools must now be maintained over time, bringing us right back to the above discussion: the difficulty in finding the time, money, and expertise to conduct software maintenance activities for analysis tools that others rely on.A tremendous increase in the quality of open research software can be achieved (i) by making the development of FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) [29,30] and sustainable software a core mission of image analysis facilities (or analysis teams within imaging facilities) [31], (ii) by adding stable RSE positions to teams of bioimage analysts, and (iii) by facilitating networking activities between such teams across different facilities. We believe this would lead to more powerful and general-purpose core libraries that would be developed, maintained, and used by a larger group of research software engineers. As a consequence, users would have access to a set of software tools that have a higher degree of stability, interoperability and require less maintenance thanks to shared maintenance efforts, rather than duplicated ones. Additionally, this would mean that more RSEs would be involved in developing such core libraries, which would in turn increase those libraries bus-factor1 and thereby mitigate many of the software maintenance problems arising from single individuals leaving their jobs. All together, this would result in a more efficient translation from new methods to usable tools that can benefit bench scientists and therefore directly elevate the rate of scientific discovery.Still, increased hiring of research software engineers alone is not a guarantee for success. It is also imperative to collaborate across team and institute boundaries and to broadly establish modern software development practices. At times, research software is hastily written and \&quot;just good enough\&quot; to demonstrate a working principle, but not of sufficient quality to easily reuse, share, or build other components stably on top of it. The more general purpose a library or software component is, the more important it is to invest in a good design that enables its reuse. This also means to invest in automated testing and good documentation. Such things take additional time at first, but pay back the investment many times over the lifetime of a software project. As coordinated exchange of best-practices and peer-teaching will become important, we believe that establishing specialized bioimage analysis RSE networks that review and give feedback on each other\&\#39;s activities will be a key component to ensure that global RSE work is as efficient as it can be.If our argument to include such a network of RSE teams within image analysis facilities is more broadly implemented, we believe that a number of benefits will naturally and directly emerge. In particular, we expect the following benefits to be a direct consequence:User-driven requirement assessment: Bioimage analysts are the interface to bench scientists and microscopists who generate raw image data that needs to be analyzed. As such, they observe every day which analyses are well supported by user-friendly tools, and where gaps exist in the tool landscape. This knowledge, shared with research software engineers and method developers, is key to directing their attention to the most important problems that need addressing.Bioimage analysts are often the first to use new analysis tools and methods and they typically do so in the context of multiple analysis projects, requiring a broader spectrum of features. Last but not least, bioimage analysts not only use software tools but also help others use them on their own. The feedback of bioimage analysts on existing pain points for users can therefore be invaluable for research software engineers who seek to improve their tools. By embedding RSEs within image analysis facilities, a constant feedback stream will help to steer development efforts to where they are most needed and therefore avoid wasting resources.Long-term maintenance of software tools and components: Close collaboration between analysts and RSEs ensures that software tools and the libraries they depend on stay well maintained and that functionality-impeding bugs will be resolved quickly. Additionally, the distribution of knowledge over multiple people will increase the above mentioned bus-factor, enabling RSE teams to retain expertise even if some members leave.Software interoperability and deduplication of effort: Bioimage analysis and imaging facilities are and need to remain well networked. RSEs within such teams can use these networks to synchronize and deduplicate efforts across teams and institutions. As a consequence, once common libraries are developed and used, software tools will become interoperable, even if not developed collaboratively. This will reduce the cost of research software development, free up much needed RSE time, and most importantly, benefit users who need interoperable software tools for their analyses [7,33].Better software engineering and better career paths for RSEs: Finally, housing RSE teams within imaging or analysis facilities will foster the dissemination of modern software engineering skills [34,35]. Networked RSEs will naturally exchange best-practices. Not only will RSEs themselves benefit from this accumulated knowledge, these skills can also be shared with PhD students and post-docs who develop computational methods and are therefore working at the interface with software tool development. Additionally, more places employing RSEs will automatically create an environment where RSEs can switch between jobs, without having to leave academia, and will create new career opportunities for RSE-inclined students or post-docs [36].If these statements are so obvious, why are many funders and institutions not investing in such ideas? We believe that multiple factors come together. Software development methods have improved tremendously over the past decades. Dependency management, code versioning tools, test-driven development, continuous integration, platforms such as Github, etc. all contribute to making distributed software development possible. Hence, our ideas would have been much harder to realize in the 1990s than they are now. Additionally, the return on investment is not easily quantifiable, at least not until enough institutions commit to the interconnected research software engineering and maintenance model we propose. Still, we now benefit from the necessary infrastructure required to collect useful KPIs regarding which software and libraries are successful and widely used. For example: reporting the number of new software versions being released each year, their usage through download statistics, the number of users interacting with the developers through public platforms such as image.sc or Github, the number of forks or stars project repositories receive, or more classical indicators such as citations/mentions in the literature. Additional KPIs can be collected based on teaching and consulting events and user feedback, or by estimating the benefit of using certain software tools in projects conducted within a facility (e.g. in terms of enabled projects or estimated overhead time if the analysis was conducted without those tools).While this strategy should hopefully find application in many places, we are currently implementing such a structure at Human Technopole within NoBIAS, the National Bioimage Analysis Service, which is part of the new National Facility for Data Handling and Analysis. We firmly believe that a strong RSE team is a key ingredient for a truly successful image analysis facility that aims at serving many users in the context of heterogeneous life science projects. As part of this commitment, we have built our facility around a model which integrates an RSE team as a core part of the facility. This team has a broad mandate to support the activities of the facility, including code review and optimization for our analysis pipelines, casting new methods into user-friendly tools that can then be used first by the analysis team and then later also by the facility users and the scientific community. Another key part of the NoBIAS RSEs mandate is the maintenance of previously developed tools and contribution to open source projects created by others. We are aiming at accelerating the rate of scientific discovery not only for our users on campus and within our national user base, but also for life science research more globally. In addition to enhancing the ability of our facility to serve our users, we hope that such a model will function as a proof-of-concept for the ideas outlined in this opinion piece, and as an example to other facilities of the advantages of integrating RSEs into an image analysis facility.},

Cities are also experiencing poor—and in some cases worsening—air quality, contributing to large disease burdens for adults and children. Integrated planning frameworks can help cities leverage and prioritize measures that achieve climate, air quality, and health benefits simultaneously. We developed and applied an integrated climate action planning process that includes air quality, utilizing Pathways-AQ, a new assessment tool, in six pilot cities: Accra, Ghana; Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; Buenos Aires, Argentina; the metropolitan area of Guadalajara, Mexico; Johannesburg, South Africa; and Lima, Peru. Implementing the “ambitious” greenhouse gas reduction scenarios in these cities' climate action plans would reduce in-city contributions to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations and would avoid 230–1,040 annual premature deaths per city, by 2050. This new integrated climate action planning process revealed the importance of (i) geographic scales of analysis, (ii) data integration across climate and air quality, (iii) local civic engagement, and (iv) nuanced health messaging. Rapidly scaling up and applying this integrated approach can broaden the group of municipal stakeholders involved in climate-related planning goals, potentially leading to greater ambition by integrating climate, air pollution, and health objectives.},

	abstract = {South Africa remains an uncharted realm in terms of marine mobile emissions inventory and hence the impact of pollution from ships in coastal cities remains unknown. Such a void creates uncertainties about the extent of population exposure to pollution from ships, the health impact and economic value associated with the changes in policies for the port city of Durban. This study was aimed at estimating the health and economic impact of marine mobile emissions and the health and economic benefits associated with improvement in air quality within the port city of Durban, which is under eThekwini municipality. The population exposure to particulate matter of less than 2.5 and 10 μm (PM2.5 and PM10) and sulphur dioxide (SO2) from ships calling into Durban port were estimated using the AERMOD air dispersion model. The BenMAP modelling tool was then used to estimate the health impact and economic value of changes in emission of PM2.5, PM10 and SO2 from ships visiting Durban port. The reduction in emissions from ships was due to the reduction in the sulphur content of fuel from 3.5\% to 0.5\% that was implemented by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) on the 01st of January 2020. The results showed that PM2.5 and PM10 emissions reduced by 63\% in 2020 compared to 2018, whilst SO2 emissions reduced by 82\% over the same period. The BenMAP results indicated that 49 premature mortalities were avoided in 2020 compared to 2018 since the IMO's forced reduction in sulphur content of fuel by 85\% in 2020. These avoided cases on mortality were estimated a monetary value of R228 million using the World Bank’s 2016 estimates and R683 million using the USEPA Mean VSL estimate. Such monetary values were respectively equivalent to 0.05\% and 0.2\% of the eThekwini's GDP, which was estimated at R468 billion in 2016.},

This review reveals that since the 1980’s particulate matter (PM) concentrations in some Nairobi locations, such as the industrial area, have been at dangerously high levels. Almost all of the studies included show that PM concentrations in Nairobi violate the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. Moreover, black carbon (BC) concentrations in Nairobi are among the highest in the world, indicating the need for cleaner vehicles in the city. There has been much less work done measuring the levels of gaseous pollutant concentrations in Kenya.

	abstract = {Pregnancy and early childhood are periods with high plasticity in neurological development. Environmental perturbations during these sensitive windows can have lifelong developmental consequences. This review summarizes key findings relevant to the effects of air pollution on neurological development. Mounting evidence suggests that exposure to air pollution, both during pregnancy and childhood, is associated with childhood developmental outcomes ranging from changes in brain structures to subclinical deficits in developmental test scores, and, ultimately, developmental disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorders or autism spectrum disorders. Although the biological mechanisms of effects remain to be elucidated, multiple pathways are probably involved and include oxidative stress, inflammation, and/or endocrine disruption. Given the alarming global increase in developmental disorders in recent years, and increased human exposures to pollution, it is critical to reduce personal and community-level exposures through tight collaboration of interdisciplinary and multi-level bodies including community partners, physicians, industry partners, policy makers, public health practitioners, and researchers. What this paper adds Exposure to air pollution is associated with a range of childhood developmental complications. Biological mechanisms may include oxidative stress, inflammation, and endocrine disruption.},

	abstract = {Air pollution is a global health challenge, increasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases such as heart disease, stroke, and arrhythmias. Particulate matter (PM), particularly PM2.5 and ultrafine particles (UFP), is a key contributor to the adverse effects of air pollution on cardiovascular health. PM exposure can lead to oxidative stress, inflammation, atherosclerosis, vascular dysfunction, cardiac arrhythmias, and myocardial injury. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a key role in mediating these effects. PM exposure can also lead to hypertension, a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a significant reduction of air pollutants, leading to a decline in the incidence of heart attacks and premature deaths caused by cardiovascular diseases. This review highlights the relationship between environmental air quality and cardiovascular health, elucidating the pathways through which air pollutants affect the cardiovascular system. It also emphasizes the need for increased awareness, collective efforts to mitigate the adverse effects of air pollution, and strategic policies for long-term air quality improvement to prevent the devastating effects of air pollution on global cardiovascular health.},

	abstract = {Pollution is a leading cause of premature morbidity and mortality and an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Convincing data predict increased rates of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality with current and projected pollution burden trends. Multiple classes of pollutants – including criteria air pollutants, secondhand smoke, toxic steel pollutants, and manufactured chemical pollutants – are associated with varied cardiovascular disease risk profiles. To reduce the future risk of cardiovascular disease from anthropogenic pollution, mitigation strategies, both at the individual level and population level, must be thoughtfully and intentionally employed. The literature supporting individual level interventions to protect against cardiovascular disease is growing but lacks large clinical trials. Population level interventions are crucial to larger societal change and rely upon policy and governmental support. While these mitigation strategies can play a major role in maintaining the health of individuals, planetary health – the impact on human health because of anthropogenic perturbation of natural ecosystems – must also be acknowledged. Future research is needed to further delineate the planetary health implications of current and projected pollutant burden as well as the mitigation strategies employed to attenuate future pollutant burden.},

	abstract = {Background:
Previous studies of short-term ambient air pollution exposure and asthma morbidity in the United States have been limited to a small number of cities and/or pollutants and with limited consideration of effects across ages.

Objectives:
To estimate acute age group-specific effects of fine and coarse particulate matter (PM), major PM components, and gaseous pollutants on emergency department (ED) visits for asthma during 2005–2014 across the United States.

Methods:
We acquired ED visit and air quality data in regions surrounding 53 speciation sites in 10 states. We used quasi-Poisson log-linear time-series models with unconstrained distributed exposure lags to estimate site-specific acute effects of air pollution on asthma ED visits overall and by age group (1–4, 5–17, 18–49, 50–64, and 65+ y), controlling for meteorology, time trends, and influenza activity. We then used a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate pooled associations from site-specific associations.

Results:
Our analysis included 3.19 million asthma ED visits. We observed positive associations for multiday cumulative exposure to all air pollutants examined [e.g., 8-d exposure to PM2.5: rate ratio of 1.016 with 95\% credible interval (CI) of (1.008, 1.025) per 6.3-μg/m3 increase, PM10–2.5: 1.014 (95\% CI: 1.007, 1.020) per 9.6-μg/m3 increase, organic carbon: 1.016 (95\% CI: 1.009, 1.024) per 2.8-μg/m3 increase, and ozone: 1.008 (95\% CI: 0.995, 1.022) per 0.02-ppm increase]. PM2.5 and ozone showed stronger effects at shorter lags, whereas associations of traffic-related pollutants (e.g., elemental carbon and oxides of nitrogen) were generally stronger at longer lags. Most pollutants had more pronounced effects on children ({\textless}18 y old) than adults; PM2.5 had strong effects on both children and the elderly ({\textgreater}64 y old); and ozone had stronger effects on adults than children.

Conclusions:
We reported positive associations between short-term air pollution exposure and increased rates of asthma ED visits. We found that air pollution exposure posed a higher risk for children and older populations. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP11661},

	abstract = {Ambient air pollution is a well-known risk factor of various asthma-related outcomes, however, past research has often focused on acute exacerbations rather than asthma development. This study draws on a population-based, multigenerational panel dataset from the United States to assess the association of childhood asthma risk with census block-level, annual-average air pollution exposure measured during the prenatal and early postnatal periods, as well as effect modification by neighborhood poverty. Findings suggest that early-life exposures to nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), a marker of traffic-related pollution, and fine particulate matter (PM2.5), a mixture of industrial and other pollutants, are positively associated with subsequent childhood asthma diagnosis (OR = 1.25, 95\% CI = 1.10⁻1.41 and OR = 1.25, 95\% CI = 1.06⁻1.46, respectively, per interquartile range (IQR) increase in each pollutant (NO₂ IQR = 8.51 ppb and PM2.5 IQR = 4.43 µ/m³)). These effects are modified by early-life neighborhood poverty exposure, with no or weaker effects in moderate- and low- (versus high-) poverty areas. This work underscores the importance of a holistic, developmental approach to elucidating the interplay of social and environmental contexts that may create conditions for racial-ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in childhood asthma risk.},

Although air pollutants are associated with poor outcomes, few national studies have examined associations between pollutant levels and inpatient pediatric pneumonia outcomes. We examined the relationship between ozone (O3) and fine particulate matter with a diameter ≤2.5 µm (PM2.5) and outcomes related to disease severity.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we obtained discharge data from the 2007 to 2008 Nationwide Inpatient Sample and pollution data from the Air Quality System.

However, the successful interpretation of satellite data requires an understanding of how satellites relate to other data sources, as well as factors affecting their application to health challenges. Drawing from the expertise and experience of the 2016–2020 NASA HAQAST (Health and Air Quality Applied Sciences Team), we present a review of satellite data for air quality and health applications. We include a discussion of satellite data for epidemiological studies and health impact assessments, as well as the use of satellite data to evaluate air quality trends, support air quality regulation, characterize smoke from wildfires, and quantify emission sources. The primary advantage of satellite data compared to in situ measurements, e.g., from air quality monitoring stations, is their spatial coverage. Satellite data can reveal where pollution levels are highest around the world, how levels have changed over daily to decadal periods, and where pollutants are transported from urban to global scales. To date, air quality and health applications have primarily utilized satellite observations and satellite-derived products relevant to near-surface particulate matter \&lt;2.5 μm in diameter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Health and air quality communities have grown increasingly engaged in the use of satellite data, and this trend is expected to continue. From health researchers to air quality managers, and from global applications to community impacts, satellite data are transforming the way air pollution exposure is evaluated.},

	abstract = {We are witnessing an enormous growth in the volume of data generated by various online services. An important portion of this data contains geographic references, since many of these services are location-enhanced and thus produce spatio-temporal records of their usage. We postulate that the spatio-temporal usage records belonging to the same real-world entity can be matched across records from different location-enhanced services. Linking spatio-temporal records enables data analysts and service providers to obtain information that they cannot derive by analyzing only one set of usage records. In this paper, we develop a new linkage model that can be used to match entities from two sets of spatio-temporal usage records belonging to two different location-enhanced services. This linkage model is based on the concept of k-l diversity-that we developed to capture both spatial and temporal aspects of the linkage. To realize this linkage model in practice, we develop a scalable linking algorithm called ST-Link, which makes use of effective spatial and temporal filtering mechanisms that significantly reduce the search space for matching users. Furthermore, ST-Link utilizes sequential scan procedures to avoid random disk access and thus scales to large datasets. We evaluated our work with respect to accuracy and performance using several datasets. Experiments show that ST-Link is effective in practice for performing spatio-temporal linkage and can scale to large datasets.},

	abstract = {Weather and climate play important roles in determining patterns of air quality over multiple scales in time and space, owing to the fact that emissions, transport, dilution, chemical transformation, and eventual deposition of air pollutants all can be influenced by meteorologic variables such as temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and mixing height. There is growing recognition that development of optimal control strategies for key pollutants like ozone and fine particles now requires assessment of potential future climate conditions and their influence on the attainment of air quality objectives. In addition, other air contaminants of relevance to human health, including smoke from wildfires and airborne pollens and molds, may be influenced by climate change. In this study, the focus is on the ways in which health-relevant measures of air quality, including ozone, particulate matter, and aeroallergens, may be affected by climate variability and change. The small but growing literature focusing on climate impacts on air quality, how these influences may play out in future decades, and the implications for human health is reviewed. Based on the observed and anticipated impacts, adaptation strategies and research needs are discussed.},

This study is the first to combine atmospheric sensor data with real-time, geo-positioned hay fever symptom reports to examine the relationship between symptom severity and air quality, weather and land use. We study 36145 symptom reports submitted over 5 years by over 700 UK residents using a mobile application. Scores were recorded for nose, eyes and breathing. Symptom reports are labelled as urban or rural using land-use data from the UK’s Office for National Statistics. Reports are compared with AURN network pollution measurements and pollen and meteorological data taken from the UK Met Office. Our analysis suggests urban areas record significantly higher symptom severity for all years except 2017. Rural areas do not record significantly higher symptom severity in any year. Additionally, symptom severity correlates with more air quality markers in urban areas than rural areas, indicating that differences in allergy symptoms may be due to variations in the levels of pollutants, pollen counts and seasonality across land-use types. The results suggest that a relationship exists between urban surroundings and hay fever symptoms.},

Together, those activities capture entanglements of data transformations and data-intensive practices. We develop the framework through a qualitative study of digitisation in Environmental Assessment (EA) practice. EA practitioners reflect on their experiences working with digital environmental data through ten semi-structured and two interactive interviews. The paper offers two main contributions. First, we develop a data journey theoretical framework and show that it is useful as a unit of analysis for uncovering tensions in data-oriented activities.

	abstract = {Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease affecting approximately 20\% of children globally. While studies have been conducted elsewhere, air pollution and weather variability is not well studied in the tropics. This time-series study examines the association between air pollution and meteorological factors with the incidence of outpatient visits for AD obtained from the National Skin Centre (NSC) in Singapore. The total number of 1,440,844 consultation visits from the NSC from 2009 to 2019 was analysed. Using the distributed lag non-linear model and assuming a negative binomial distribution, the short-term temporal association between outpatient visits for AD and air quality and meteorological variability on a weekly time-scale were examined, while adjusting for long-term trends, seasonality and autocorrelation. The analysis was also stratified by gender and age to assess potential effect modification. The risk of AD consultation visits was 14\% lower (RR10th percentile: 0.86, 95\% CI 0.78–0.96) at the 10th percentile (11.9 µg/m3) of PM2.5 and 10\% higher (RR90th percentile: 1.10, 95\% CI 1.01–1.19) at the 90th percentile (24.4 µg/m3) compared to the median value (16.1 µg/m3). Similar results were observed for PM10 with lower risk at the 10th percentile and higher risk at the 90th percentile (RR10th percentile: 0.86, 95\% CI 0.78–0.95, RR90th percentile: 1.10, 95\% CI 1.01–1.19). For rainfall for values above the median, the risk of consultation visits was higher up to 7.4 mm in the PM2.5 model (RR74th percentile: 1.07, 95\% CI 1.00–1.14) and up to 9 mm in the PM10 model (RR80th percentile: 1.12, 95\% CI 1.00–1.25). This study found a close association between outpatient visits for AD with ambient particulate matter concentrations and rainfall. Seasonal variations in particulate matter and rainfall may be used to alert healthcare providers on the anticipated rise in AD cases and to time preventive measures to reduce the associated health burden.},

Through the lens of these distinct domains, the chapter explores different purposes served by provenance; various ways that diverse fields are capturing, representing and using provenance information; provenance standards and specifications, and a range of open research challenges relating to theorizing about provenance and capturing, representing and using provenance information in increasingly distributed, heterogeneous information eco-systems combining machine and human intelligence. From this blending of perspectives on provenance from different disciplines and ‘interdisciplines’, a rich picture emerges of provenance as a dynamic construct and evolving focus of research.},

In other words, they are being used interchangeably and it seems difficult for the researcher to choose between them. In this respect, this paper describes and discusses the boundaries between qualitative content analysis and thematic analysis and presents implications to improve the consistency between the purpose of related studies and the method of data analyses. This is a discussion paper, comprising an analytical overview and discussion of the definitions, aims, philosophical background, data gathering, and analysis of content analysis and thematic analysis, and addressing their methodological subtleties. It is concluded that in spite of many similarities between the approaches, including cutting across data and searching for patterns and themes, their main difference lies in the opportunity for quantification of data. It means that measuring the frequency of different categories and themes is possible in content analysis with caution as a proxy for significance.},

Earth observation data has the 4V features (volume, variety, veracity, and velocity) of big data that are suitable for climate change research. Moreover, the large amount of data available from scientific satellites plays an important role. This study reviews the advances of climate change studies based on Earth observation big data and provides examples of case studies that utilize Earth observation big data in climate change research, such as synchronous satellite–aerial–ground observation experiments, which provide extremely large and abundant datasets; Earth observational sensitive factors (e.g., glaciers, lakes, vegetation, radiation, and urbanization); and global environmental change information and simulation systems. With the era of global environment change dawning, Earth observation big data will underpin the Future Earth program with a huge volume of various types of data and will play an important role in academia and decisionmaking. Inevitably, Earth observation big data will encounter opportunities and challenges brought about by global climate change.},

Later, we discuss the data quality issues and characteristics of the EHRs along with the relevant methods used to address them. Moreover, this survey also highlights the usage of various data types for different applications.

	abstract = {In the present technological era, healthcare providers generate huge amounts of clinical data on a daily basis. Generated clinical data is stored digitally in the form of Electronic Health Record (EHR) as a central data repository of hospitals. Data contained in EHR is not only used for the patients' primary care but also for various secondary purposes such as clinical research, automated disease surveillance and clinical audits for quality enhancement. Using EHR data for secondary purposes without consent or in some cases even with consent creates privacy issues. Secondly, EHR data is also made accessible to various stakeholders including different government agencies at various geographical sites through wired or wireless networks. Sharing of EHR across multiple agencies makes it vulnerable to cyber attacks and also makes it difficult to implement strict privacy laws as in some cases data is shared with organization that is governed by specific regional law. Privacy of individuals could be severely affected when their sensitive private information contained in EHR is leaked or exposed to the public. Data leaks can cause financial losses or an individual may encounter social boycott if his / her medical condition is exposed in public. To protect patients personal data from such threats, there exists different privacy regulations such as General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and My Health Record (MHR). However, continually evolving state-of-the-art techniques in Machine Learning (ML), Data Analytics (DA) and hacking are making it even more difficult to completely protect an individual's/patient's privacy. In this article, we have systematically examined various secondary uses of EHR with the aim to highlight how these secondary uses affect patients' privacy. Secondly, we have critically analyzed GDPR \& HIPAA regulations and highlighted their possible areas of improvement, considering escalating use of technology and different secondary uses of EHR.},

	abstract = {Wearable sensors and social networking platforms play a key role in providing a new method to collect patient data for efficient healthcare monitoring. However, continuous patient monitoring using wearable sensors generates a large amount of healthcare data. In addition, the user-generated healthcare data on social networking sites come in large volumes and are unstructured. The existing healthcare monitoring systems are not efficient at extracting valuable information from sensors and social networking data, and they have difficulty analyzing it effectively. On top of that, the traditional machine learning approaches are not enough to process healthcare big data for abnormality prediction. Therefore, a novel healthcare monitoring framework based on the cloud environment and a big data analytics engine is proposed to precisely store and analyze healthcare data, and to improve the classification accuracy. The proposed big data analytics engine is based on data mining techniques, ontologies, and bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM). Data mining techniques efficiently preprocess the healthcare data and reduce the dimensionality of the data. The proposed ontologies provide semantic knowledge about entities and aspects, and their relations in the domains of diabetes and blood pressure (BP). Bi-LSTM correctly classifies the healthcare data to predict drug side effects and abnormal conditions in patients. Also, the proposed system classifies the patients’ health condition using their healthcare data related to diabetes, BP, mental health, and drug reviews. This framework is developed employing the Protégé Web Ontology Language tool with Java. The results show that the proposed model precisely handles heterogeneous data and improves the accuracy of health condition classification and drug side effect predictions.},

We aimed to examine the excess emergency department (ED) visits related to the 2019–20 bushfires in New South Wales (NSW). We obtained weekly data of ED visits for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases in all the 28 Statistical Area Level 4 (SA4) regions in NSW during the bushfire seasons from 2017 to 2020. A two-stage interrupted time-series analysis was applied to quantify the excess risk for ED visits in 2019–20. The total number of excess ED visits, excess percentages, and their empirical confidence intervals (eCIs) were calculated to estimate the impacts of the bushfire season. A total of 416,057 records of cardiorespiratory ED visits were included in our analysis. The bushfire season in 2019–20 was significantly associated with a 6.0\% increase (95\% eCI: 1.9, 10.3) in ED visits for respiratory diseases and a 10.0\% increase (95\% eCI: 5.0, 15.2) for cardiovascular diseases, corresponding to 6177 (95\% eCI: 1989, 10,166) and 3120 (95\% eCI: 1628, 4544) excess ED visits, respectively. The percentage of excess ED visits was higher in regions with lower SES and high fire density.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Sub-Saharan Africa is among the regions that contribute least to global climate change, yet it is among the most vulnerable to its impacts due to low levels of economic and technological development. The frequency and magnitude of extreme weather events in the region are rising at a faster rate than the population capacity to deal with the attendant disasters. This paper interrogates some emerging and existing evidence of the potential for extreme weather events to obviate countries' attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Whilst previous studies have assessed the vulnerabilities of sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries to extreme weather events on specific sectors, a comprehensive assessment of the implications of these extreme events for attaining the SDGs remains largely untouched. This paper assesses the impacts of flooding, extreme heat and drought on five key SDGs—Zero hunger (Goal 2), Good health and well-being (Goal 3), Quality education (Goal 4), Clean water and sanitation (Goal 6), and Sustainable cities and communities (Goal 11). Based on empirical cases from different SSA country contexts, and guided by the SDG targets and indicators, we discuss the main interactions between extreme weather events and different SDGs, emerging with a framework for the climate change—sustainable development nexus. Such an assessment, with regard to specific national and local case studies, would inform policy formulation and implementation, research and investment toward sustainable development in the region. Integrating resilence strategies into national development policies will offer sub-Saharan African countries the opportunity to reduce the impacts of extreme weather events on attaining their targets for sustainable development towards Agenda 2030.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

While it is common to identify studies conducted to assess how climate change independently impacts water, land, or food resources, very limited studies have sought to address the interlinkages, synergies, and trade-offs existing between climate change, water, land, and food (WLF) resources as a system in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The climate change and WLF security nexus, therefore, seeks to address this shortfall in literature and subsequently serve as a relevant source of information for decision-making and policy implementation concerning climate change mitigation and adaptation. In this study, 41 relevant studies were selected from Web of Science, Google Scholar, ResearchGate, and institutional websites. We provide information on the independent relationships between climate change and WLF resources, and further discuss the existing inter-linkages between climate change and the WLF security in SSA using the nexus approach, with recommendations on how decision making and policy implementations should be done using the climate change and WLF security nexus approach.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Vector-borne diseases (VBDs) are a major threat to human health. Climate change has a significant impact on VBDs. To clarify the complex effects of climate change on VBDs, we concluded the effects of climate on the transmission and spread of VBDs from an ecological perspective and summarized VBD changes in response to climate change, specifically including: the nonlinear effects of local climate (temperature, precipitation and wind) on VBD transmission, especially temperature showing n-shape effects; regional climate (the El Niño–Southern Oscillation and North Atlantic Oscillation) has time-lag effects on VBD transmission through indirect impact on local climate; and the u-shaped effect of extreme climates can lead to the geographical spread of VBDs. In terms of non-climatic factors, land use and human mobility through the interactions with climatic factors, will affect transmission and spread of VBD. We further explored the uncertainty of the impact of climate change on VBDs under the COVID-19 pandemic. A systematic understanding of the impact of climate change on the transmission and spread of VBD can provide insights and suggestions for future research on VBD prevention and control.

Abstract
Climate change affects ecosystems and human health in multiple dimensions. With the acceleration of climate change, climate-sensitive vector-borne diseases (VBDs) pose an increasing threat to public health. This paper summaries 10 publications on the impacts of climate change on ecosystems and human health; then it synthesizes the other existing literature to more broadly explain how climate change drives the transmission and spread of VBDs through an ecological perspective. We highlight the multi-dimensional nature of climate change, its interaction with other factors, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on transmission and spread of VBDs, specifically including: (1) the generally nonlinear relationship of local climate (temperature, precipitation and wind) and VBD transmission, with temperature especially exhibiting an n-shape relation; (2) the time-lagged effect of regional climate phenomena (the El Niño–Southern Oscillation and North Atlantic Oscillation) on VBD transmission; (3) the u-shaped effect of extreme climate (heat waves, cold waves, floods, and droughts) on VBD spread; (4) how interactions between non-climatic (land use and human mobility) and climatic factors increase VBD transmission and spread; and (5) that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on climate change is debatable, and its impact on VBDs remains uncertain. By exploring the influence of climate change and non-climatic factors on VBD transmission and spread, this paper provides scientific understanding and guidance for their effective prevention and control.},

	abstract = {Climate change severely affects sub-Saharan African economies in several ways: increased temperatures, erratic rainfall variability patterns, and recurrent droughts and floods. Such adverse climate change effects may result in a greater incidence of crop pests, loss of soil moisture content, rapid soil nutrient depletion and substantial decreases in crop productivity and yields. These effects in combination with lack of access to improved, high-yielding crop varieties, limited agricultural extension services and poor access to irrigation infrastructure could further threaten access to food, limit export earnings and markedly lower net crop revenue. Several definitions, assessment approaches and methods for the concepts related to “vulnerability” and “adaptation” exist due to complex nature of climate impact and strategies used to deal with them. Based on the context of such studies, this paper reviews climate change risks, people’s vulnerability to such risks as well as synthesize different approaches, methods and models used to assess vulnerability and adaptation in the area of agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa. As climate change effects are complex and site-specific, the understanding of several concepts, approaches and methods provides detailed information on farmers’ vulnerability and adaptation process. Such information would be useful to inform adaptation interventions and agricultural policies that build farmers’ resilience.},

This paper investigates the economic impact of climate change on food security in SSA. Panel data of all SSA countries are used in the analysis, to analyze the impact of temperature and precipitation on food security. Their coefficient of variation is used to analyze their impact on food security. The results from the analysis indicate that the coefficient of variations in both temperature and precipitation affects food security negatively. The climate variables affect food security directly through its impact on food production and indirectly through its impact on other food security indicators. The study recommends ecosystem management and production system improvement. According to the findings, the impact of climate change on food security in the SSA region is damaging. To overcome the impact, the study suggests appropriate land use policy formulation, natural resource conservation, implementing best agronomic practices and maintaining the number of population at an optimum level in the region.},

Research has shown that diesel exhaust exposure can have many detrimental effects on the cardiovascular system both acutely and chronically. This review provides an overview of the cardiovascular effects on PM in air pollution, with an emphasis on ultrafine particles in vehicle exhaust. We consider the biological mechanisms underlying these cardiovascular effects of PM and postulate that cardiovascular dysfunction may be implicated in the effects of PM in other organ systems.

Although many factors were attributed to influencing volatile compounds' emission, only mankind's activities are mainly proclaimed. Since vehicle and industrial pollution are mounting for years and years, urban areas are highly prone to the impacts of VOCs. Generally, volatile compounds are highly spontaneous and readily react with the particles of ambiance and produce a polluted atmosphere through several physical and chemical reactions.

	abstract = {The impacts of climate change and air pollution on respiratory diseases present significant global health challenges. This review aims to investigate the effects of the interactions between these challenges focusing on respiratory diseases. Climate change is predicted to increase the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events amplifying air pollution levels and exacerbating respiratory diseases. Air pollution levels are projected to rise due to ongoing economic growth and population expansion in many areas worldwide, resulting in a greater burden of respiratory diseases. This is especially true among vulnerable populations like children, older adults, and those with pre-existing respiratory disorders. These challenges induce inflammation, create oxidative stress, and impair the immune system function of the lungs. Consequently, public health measures are required to mitigate the effects of climate change and air pollution on respiratory health. The review proposes that reducing greenhouse gas emissions contribute to slowing down climate change and lessening the severity of extreme weather events. Enhancing air quality through regulatory and technological innovations also helps reduce the morbidity of respiratory diseases. Moreover, policies and interventions aimed at improving healthcare access and social support can assist in decreasing the vulnerability of populations to the adverse health effects of air pollution and climate change. In conclusion, there is an urgent need for continuous research, establishment of policies, and public health efforts to tackle the complex and multi-dimensional challenges of climate change, air pollution, and respiratory health. Practical and comprehensive interventions can protect respiratory health and enhance public health outcomes for all.},

Using a novel dataset from the Indonesian national health insurance scheme Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional/Badan Penyelenggara Jaminan Sosial (BPJS) and linking it with meteorological data on the daily-district level, I estimate the causal effect of high temperatures on the daily number of primary health care visits. The results show that on a hot day all-cause visits and visits with a diagnosis of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases increase by 8\%, 25\% and 14\%, respectively. These increases are permanent and not offset by visit displacement or ‘harvesting’. Visits related to respiratory diseases seem not to be affected by high temperatures. I use several climate change scenarios to predict the increase in visits and costs by the end of the century, which all forecast a substantial financial burden for the health care system.

The impacts of air pollutants on health range from short-term health impairments to hospital admissions and deaths. Climate change is leading to an increase in air pollution.

Methods
This article addresses, based on selected literature, the relationship between climate change and air pollutants, the health effects of air pollutants and their modification by air temperature, with a focus on Germany.

Results
Poor air quality increases the risk of many diseases. Climate change is causing, among other things, more periods of extreme heat with simultaneously increased concentrations of air pollutants. The interactions between air temperature and air pollutants, as well as their combined effects on human health, have not yet been sufficiently studied. Limit, target, and guideline values are of particular importance for health protection.

Conclusions
Measures to reduce air pollutants and greenhouse gases must be more strictly implemented. An essential step towards improving air quality is setting stricter air quality limit values in Europe. Prevention and adaptation measures should be accelerated in Germany, as they contribute to climate-resilient and sustainable healthcare systems.},

A two-stage interrupted time-series analysis was applied to quantify the excess risk for ED visits in 2019–20. The total number of excess ED visits, excess percentages, and their empirical confidence intervals (eCIs) were calculated to estimate the impacts of the bushfire season. A total of 416,057 records of cardiorespiratory ED visits were included in our analysis. The bushfire season in 2019–20 was significantly associated with a 6.0\% increase (95\% eCI: 1.9, 10.3) in ED visits for respiratory diseases and a 10.0\% increase (95\% eCI: 5.0, 15.2) for cardiovascular diseases, corresponding to 6177 (95\% eCI: 1989, 10,166) and 3120 (95\% eCI: 1628, 4544) excess ED visits, respectively. The percentage of excess ED visits was higher in regions with lower SES and high fire density. In the context of climate change, more targeted strategies should be developed to prevent adverse bushfire effects and recover from such extreme environmental events.},

At the same time, it is widely known that extreme weather events intrinsically exacerbate air pollution impact. Particularly, hot weather and extreme temperatures during heat waves (HW) significantly affect human health, increasing risks of respiratory mortality and morbidity. Concurrently, a synergistic effect of air pollution and high temperatures can be combined with weather–air pollution interaction during wildfires. The purpose of the current review is to summarize literature on interplay of hot weather, air pollution, and respiratory health consequences worldwide, with the ultimate goal of identifying the most dangerous pollution agents and vulnerable population groups. A literature search was conducted using electronic databases Web of Science, Pubmed, Science Direct, and Scopus, focusing only on peer-reviewed journal articles published in English from 2000 to 2021. The main findings demonstrate that the increased level of PM10 and O3 results in significantly higher rates of respiratory and cardiopulmonary mortality. Increments in PM2.5 and PM10, O3, CO, and NO2 concentrations during high temperature episodes are dramatically associated with higher admissions to hospital in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, daily hospital emergency transports for asthma, acute and chronic bronchitis, and premature mortality caused by respiratory disease. Excessive respiratory health risk is more pronounced in elderly cohorts and small children. Both heat waves and outdoor air pollution are synergistically linked and are expected to be more serious in the future due to greater climate instability, being a crucial threat to global public health that requires the responsible involvement of researchers at all levels. Sustainable urban planning and smart city design could significantly reduce both urban heat islands effect and air pollution.},

	abstract = {Background
There is rapidly growing evidence indicating that extreme temperature is a crucial trigger and potential activator of asthma; however, the effects of extreme temperature on asthma are inconsistently reported and the its potential mechanisms remain undefined.
Objectives
This review aims to estimate the impacts of extreme heat, extreme cold, and temperature variations on asthma by systematically summarizing the existing studies from epidemiological evidence to biological plausibility.
Methods
We conducted a systematic search in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science from inception to June 30, 2022, and we retrieved articles of epidemiology and biological studies which assessed associations between extreme temperatures and asthma. This protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021273613).
Results
From 12,435 identified records, 111 eligible studies were included in the qualitative synthesis, and 37 articles were included in the meta-analysis (20 for extreme heat, 16 for extreme cold, and 15 for temperature variations). For epidemiological evidence, we found that the synergistic effects of extreme temperatures, indoor/outdoor environments, and individual vulnerabilities are important triggers for asthma attacks, especially when there is extreme heat or cold. Meta-analysis further confirmed the associations, and the pooled relative risks for asthma attacks in extreme heat and extreme cold were 1.07 (95\%CI: 1.03–1.12) and 1.20 (95\%CI: 1.12–1.29), respectively. Additionally, this review discussed the potential inflammatory mechanisms behind the associations between extreme temperatures and asthma exacerbation, and highlighted the regulatory role of immunological pathways and transient receptor potential ion channels in asthma triggered by extreme temperatures.
Conclusions
We concluded that both extreme heat and cold could significantly increase the risk of asthma. Additionally, we proposed a potential mechanistic framework, which is important for understanding the disease pathogenesis that uncovers the complex mechanisms of asthma triggered by extreme temperatures and protects the sensitive individuals from impacts of extreme weather events and climate change.},

	abstract = {Although Nepal is a country rich in natural beauty, along with an abundance of natural resources, the children of this diverse nation still face several serious health issues arising from their own environment (water pollution, air pollution, chemical pollution, solid waste issues and drainage issues). Nepal also ranks as a highly vulnerable country to the adverse impacts of climate change. Children are more vulnerable to various infections for immunological, physiological and social reasons. Their inherent immunity diminishes within months after birth. There are risk factors for the development of various diseases, e.g. unsafe drinking water and lack of sanitation, which contribute to diarrheal diseases, trachoma, hookworm and amoebic dysentery; another risk factor is indoor air pollution. The infant mortality rate (IMR) is higher in rural areas with 55 per 1000 live births, compared to urban areas with 38 per 1000 live births. Likewise, the under-5-year-old mortality rate (MR) in rural areas is 64 and that in urban areas is 45 per 1000 live births. Around 12\% of the population suffer from chronic respiratory diseases, according to a recent study exploring the situation in Kathmandu. Pneumonia is a leading cause of mortality among children under 5 years of age in Nepalese hospitals. Children under 5 are more prone to the ill effects of polluted environments because of their less well-developed immune system. In addition, the school environment is not sufficiently healthy due to the distribution of unsafe drinking water and poor sanitation supply systems. In Nepal, mainly in the 20 Terai districts, arsenic contamination of groundwater is a public health problem. Underground water is used as drinking water in those areas, but without purification - the estimate is that around 0.5 million people live at the risk of arsenic poisoning. Within a span of 200 km from north to south, the climate of Nepal varies from arctic to tropical. The annual average air pollution concentration is 5 times above the World Health Organization (WHO) air quality guidelines, which poses a serious health risk to hundreds of thousands of Nepalese people: 133 out of 1,000,000 deaths each year are related to air pollution. Dramatically, Kathmandu city is a silent killer to walk around due to air pollution, and its air quality is ranked as the worst out of 180 countries, according to the 2018 Environmental Performance Index. However, insufficient studies have been conducted to explore children's environmental health issues. It is therefore essential to carry out more scientific studies to explore the issues of children's environmental health as environmental health problems in children are serious in the Nepalese context.},

To eliminate over-dispersion, this time series analysis used Quasi-Poisson regression. The models were controlled for the day of the week, holiday, time trend, and relative humidity. Heatwaves were defined as the maximum temperature exceeding P90th over the period from 2010 to 2018 during at least three consecutive days. Data from 31,191 hospital admissions for respiratory diseases and 29,056 hospitalizations for cardiovascular diseases were investigated in the two provinces. Associations between hospital admissions for respiratory diseases and heatwaves in Ninh Thuan were observed at lag 2, with excess risk (ER = 8.31\%, 95\% confidence interval: 0.64–16.55\%). However, heatwaves were negatively associated with cardiovascular diseases in Ca Mau, which was determined amongst the elderly (age above 60), ER = −7.28\%, 95\%CI: −13.97–−0.08\%. Heatwaves can be a risk factor for hospital admission due to respiratory diseases in Vietnam. Further studies need to be conducted to assert the link between heat waves and cardiovascular diseases.},

	abstract = {Epidemiology suggests ambient temperature is the triggers and potential activator of asthma. The role of high and low temperatures on airway inflammation of asthma, and the underlying molecular mechanism are not yet understood. A mouse model of asthma was adopted in our experiment. The BALB/c mice were exposed at different temperature for 4 h (2 h in the morning and 2 h in the afternoon) on weekday. The exposure temperatures were 10 °C, 24 °C and 40 °C. Ovalbumin (OVA) was used to sensitize the mice on days 14, 18, 22, 26, and 30, followed by an aerosol challenge for 30 min from day 32–38. After the final OVA challenge, lung function, serum protein and pulmonary inflammation were assessed. Comparing the OVA with the saline group at 24 °C, we saw a significant increase in: serum Total-IgE (p {\textless} 0.05); OVA-sIgE (p {\textless} 0.01); IL-4 (p {\textless} 0.05); IL-1β (p {\textless} 0.01); IL-6 (p {\textless} 0.01); TNF-α (p {\textless} 0.01); and the ratio of IL-4/IFN-γ (p {\textless} 0.01). At the same time, there was a significant decrease in IFN-γ (p {\textless} 0.01). As the temperature increase, there is a U shape for immune proteins and pro-inflammatory factors with a peak value at 24 °C, exception for IFN-γ (inverted U-shape). After the high and low temperature exposure, the Ri and Re increased significantly, while Cldyn decreased significantly compared with the 24 °C group. Histopathological analysis of the OVA groups showed airway remodeling, airway wall thickening and deforming, and subepithelial fibrosis. More obvious changes were found in the high and low temperature exposure groups. The immunohistochemistry suggested that TRPs changed with temperatures. High and low temperatures can aggravate airway inflammation in a mouse model of asthma. TRPs play an important role in temperature aggravation of allergic asthma. The results suggest that asthmatics should avoid exposure to high and low temperatures for too long time.},

	abstract = {Climate change is widely recognized as one of the most significant challenges facing our planet and human civilization. Human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, leading to a warming of the Earth’s climate. The relationship between climate change and cardiovascular (CV) health, mediated by air pollution and increased ambient temperatures, is complex and very heterogeneous. The main mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of CV disease at extreme temperatures involve several regulatory pathways, including temperature-sympathetic reactivity, the cold-activated renin-angiotensin system, dehydration, extreme temperature-induced electrolyte imbalances, and heat stroke-induced systemic inflammatory responses. The interplay of these mechanisms may vary based on individual factors, environmental conditions, and an overall health background. The net outcome is a significant increase in CV mortality and a higher incidence of hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), heart failure, and cardiac arrhythmias. Patients with pre-existing CV disorders may be more vulnerable to the effects of global warming and extreme temperatures. There is an urgent need for a comprehensive intervention that spans from the individual level to a systemic or global approach to effectively address this existential problem. Future programs aimed at reducing CV and environmental burdens should require cross-disciplinary collaboration involving physicians, researchers, public health workers, political scientists, legislators, and national leaders to mitigate the effects of climate change.},

In this topical review, we show that climate change and air pollution worsen each other, leading to several ecosystem-mediated effects. We highlight how increases in hot climates as a result of climate change have increased the risk of major air pollution events such as severe wildfires and dust storms. In addition, we show how altered atmospheric chemistry and changing patterns of weather conditions can promote the formation and accumulation of air pollutants: a phenomenon known as the climate penalty. We demonstrate these amplified environmental exposures and their associations to adverse cardiovascular health outcomes.

          This review examines the impact of climate change on the respiratory health of children, with a focus on temperature, humidity, air pollution, and extreme weather events. Climate change is considered the greatest health threat of our time, and children are especially at risk. This review is timely and relevant as it provides an overview of the current literature on the effects of climate change on children's respiratory health, and the implications of these findings for clinical practice and research.
          Recent findings 
          The findings of this review suggest that climate change has a significant impact on children's respiratory health, with temperature, humidity, air pollution, and extreme weather events being key contributory factors. Increases in extreme weather events such as heatwaves, wildfires, floods, droughts, hurricanes and dust storms all cause the health of children's respiratory system to be at increased risk.
          Summary 
          The findings of this review suggest that climate change has a significant impact on children's respiratory health, and that mitigation and adaptation strategies are necessary to protect children from the harmful effects of climate change and improve their respiratory health. Overall, a comprehensive and integrated approach is necessary to protect children from the increasing impacts of climate change.},

The consequences of climate change on exposed biological subjects, as well as on vulnerable societies, are a concern for the entire scientific community. Rising temperatures, heat waves, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, droughts, fires, loss of forest, and glaciers, along with disappearance of rivers and desertification, can directly and indirectly cause human pathologies that are physical and mental.

It has been shown that climate change acts on mental health with different timing. The phenomenology of the effects of climate change differs greatly—some mental disorders are common and others more specific in relation to atypical climatic conditions. Moreover, climate change also affects different population groups who are directly exposed and more vulnerable in their geographical conditions, as well as a lack of access to resources, information, and protection. Perhaps it is also worth underlining that in some papers the connection between climatic events and mental disorders was described through the introduction of new terms, coined only recently: ecoanxiety, ecoguilt, ecopsychology, ecological grief, solastalgia, biospheric concern, etc.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/sec{\textgreater}{\textless}sec{\textgreater}{\textless}title{\textgreater}Conclusions{\textless}/title{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}The effects of climate change can be direct or indirect, short-term or long-term.

	abstract = {Although several empirical studies and systematic reviews have documented the mental health impacts of global climate change, the range of impacts has not been well understood. This review examines mental health impacts of three types of climate-related events: (1) acute events such as hurricanes, floods, and wildfires; (2) subacute or long-term changes such as drought and heat stress; and (3) the existential threat of long-lasting changes, including higher temperatures, rising sea levels and a permanently altered and potentially uninhabitable physical environment. The impacts represent both direct (i.e. heat stress) and indirect (i.e. economic loss, threats to health and well-being, displacement and forced migration, collective violence and civil conflict, and alienation from a degraded environment) consequences of global climate change.},

	abstract = {Background:
Health agencies recommend that homes of heat-vulnerable occupants (e.g., older adults) be maintained below 24–28°C to prevent heat-related mortality and morbidity. However, there is limited experimental evidence to support these recommendations.

Objective:
To aid in the development of evidence-based guidance on safe indoor temperatures for temperate continental climates, we evaluated surrogate physiological outcomes linked with heat-related mortality and morbidity in older adults during simulated indoor overheating.

Methods:
Sixteen older adults [six women; median age: 72 y, interquartile range (IQR): 70–73 y; body mass index: 24.6 (IQR: 22.1–27.0) kg/m2] from the Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, region (warm summer continental climate) completed four randomized, 8-h exposures to conditions experienced indoors during hot weather in continental climates (e.g., Ontario, Canada; 64 participant exposures). Ambient conditions simulated an air-conditioned environment (22°C; control), proposed indoor temperature upper limits (26°C), and temperatures experienced in homes without air-conditioning (31°C and 36°C). Core temperature (rectal) was monitored as the primary outcome; based on previous recommendations, between-condition differences {\textgreater}0.3°C were considered clinically meaningful.

Results:
Compared with 22°C, core temperature was elevated to a meaningful extent in 31°C [+0.7°C; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.5, 0.8] and 36°C (+0.9°C; 95\% CI: 0.8, 1.1), but not 26°C (+0.2°C, 95\% CI: 0.0, 0.3). Increasing ambient temperatures were also associated with elevated heart rate and reduced arterial blood pressure and heart rate variability at rest, as well as progressive impairments in cardiac and blood pressure responses to standing from supine.

Discussion:
Core temperature and cardiovascular strain were not appreciably altered following 8-h exposure to 26°C but increased progressively in conditions above this threshold. These data support proposals for the establishment of a 26°C indoor temperature upper limit for protecting vulnerable occupants residing in temperate continental climates from indoor overheating. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP13159},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Data science is the science of extracting meaning from potentially complex data. This is a fast moving field, drawing principles and techniques from a number of different disciplinary areas including computer science, statistics and complexity science. Data science is having a profound impact on a number of areas including commerce, health, and smart cities. This paper argues that data science can have an equal if not greater impact in the area of earth and environmental sciences, offering a rich tapestry of new techniques to support both a deeper understanding of the natural environment in all its complexities, as well as the development of well-founded mitigation and adaptation strategies in the face of climate change. The paper argues that data science for the natural environment brings about new challenges for data science, particularly around complexity, spatial and temporal reasoning, and managing uncertainty. The paper also describes a case study in environmental data science which offers up insights into the promise of the area. The paper concludes with a research roadmap highlighting 10 top challenges of environmental data science and also an invitation to become part of an international community working collaboratively on these problems.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Background FAIR (findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability) guiding principles seek the reuse of data and other digital research input, output, and objects (algorithms, tools, and workflows that led to that data) making them findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. GO FAIR - a bottom-up, stakeholder driven and self-governed initiative - defined a seven-step FAIRification process focusing on data, but also indicating the required work for metadata. This FAIRification process aims at addressing the translation of raw datasets into FAIR datasets in a general way, without considering specific requirements and challenges that may arise when dealing with some particular types of data.

  Objectives This scientific contribution addresses the architecture design of an open technological solution built upon the FAIRification process proposed by “GO FAIR” which addresses the identified gaps that such process has when dealing with health datasets.

  Methods A common FAIRification workflow was developed by applying restrictions on existing steps and introducing new steps for specific requirements of health data. These requirements have been elicited after analyzing the FAIRification workflow from different perspectives: technical barriers, ethical implications, and legal framework. This analysis identified gaps when applying the FAIRification process proposed by GO FAIR to health research data management in terms of data curation, validation, deidentification, versioning, and indexing.

  Results A technological architecture based on the use of Health Level Seven International (HL7) FHIR (fast health care interoperability resources) resources is proposed to support the revised FAIRification workflow.

  Discussion Research funding agencies all over the world increasingly demand the application of the FAIR guiding principles to health research output. Existing tools do not fully address the identified needs for health data management. Therefore, researchers may benefit in the coming years from a common framework that supports the proposed FAIRification workflow applied to health datasets.

  Conclusion Routine health care datasets or data resulting from health research can be FAIRified, shared and reused within the health research community following the proposed FAIRification workflow and implementing technical architecture.},

We have developed RNCEP, a package of functions in the open-source R language, to access, organise and visualise freely available atmospheric data from two long-term high-quality data sets with global coverage. 3. These functions retrieve data, via the Internet, for either a desired spatiotemporal extent or interpolated to a point in space and time. The package also contains functions to temporally aggregate data, producing user-defined variables, and to visualise these data on a map. 4. By making access to atmospheric data and integration with biological data easier and more flexible, we hope to facilitate and encourage the exploration of relationships between biological systems and atmospheric conditions.},

	abstract = {Association between short-term exposure to ambient air pollution and respiratory health is well documented. At the same time, it is widely known that extreme weather events intrinsically exacerbate air pollution impact. Particularly, hot weather and extreme temperatures during heat waves (HW) significantly affect human health, increasing risks of respiratory mortality and morbidity. Concurrently, a synergistic effect of air pollution and high temperatures can be combined with weather–air pollution interaction during wildfires. The purpose of the current review is to summarize literature on interplay of hot weather, air pollution, and respiratory health consequences worldwide, with the ultimate goal of identifying the most dangerous pollution agents and vulnerable population groups. A literature search was conducted using electronic databases Web of Science, Pubmed, Science Direct, and Scopus, focusing only on peer-reviewed journal articles published in English from 2000 to 2021. The main findings demonstrate that the increased level of PM10 and O3 results in significantly higher rates of respiratory and cardiopulmonary mortality. Increments in PM2.5 and PM10, O3, CO, and NO2 concentrations during high temperature episodes are dramatically associated with higher admissions to hospital in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, daily hospital emergency transports for asthma, acute and chronic bronchitis, and premature mortality caused by respiratory disease. Excessive respiratory health risk is more pronounced in elderly cohorts and small children. Both heat waves and outdoor air pollution are synergistically linked and are expected to be more serious in the future due to greater climate instability, being a crucial threat to global public health that requires the responsible involvement of researchers at all levels. Sustainable urban planning and smart city design could significantly reduce both urban heat islands effect and air pollution.},

	abstract = {Managers in complex organisations often have to make quick decisions on whether new information sharing developments are worth undertaking or not. Such decisions are hard to make, especially at an enterprise level. Both costs and risks are regularly underestimated. Existing approaches to managing risk and estimating cost are principally focused on creating detailed predictions based on substantial models of the planned development. They aim to support project managers throughout the development process itself, rather than giving a low-cost indicator for use in early-stage decision making. Our objective is to help managers and stakeholders of large, complex organisations, such as the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK, make better informed decisions on points of cost and risk of new software systems that will reuse or extend their existing information infrastructure, before any implementation is undertaken.

We analysed 18 case studies describing recent software developments introduced by providers of health care services, looking for common points of high cost and risk. From the case studies analysis, we found that the movement of data within and between organisations was a key indicator of high cost and risk. Data movement can be hindered by numerous technical barriers, but also by other challenges arising from social aspects of an organisation. Hence, we devised a catalogue of socio-technical data
movement anti-patterns that under certain conditions can introduce high cost and risk to the organisation.

In this thesis, we propose a new method aiming to identify places of high cost and risk when existing data needs to move to a new development. The method is low-cost and combines both technical and social aspects, but relies only on information that is likely to be already known to key stakeholders, or will be cheap to acquire. The method is based on the data journey model, a new lightweight technique that captures movements of data within or between organisations. The data journey model describes
an abstraction of large, complex eco-systems focusing on the high-level journeys data take through networks of people and systems.

To assess the effectiveness of our method and the accuracy of our predictions, we applied the method in real world settings in the NHS domain. We worked with clinicians to model the movements of data in five NHS studies from different Foundation Trusts across the UK. The results of the evaluation showed that our method was able to cheaply and quickly identify most of the points of high cost/risk that the hospital staff had identified, along with several other possible directions that the staff did not identify for themselves, but agreed could be promising.

Finally, the results of the evaluation showed that the data journey modelling method can be completed in less than a couple of hours (including training). Also, the simplicity of our modelling technique can empower domain experts with no particular modelling expertise to quickly identify opportunities for cost savings in new developments, as well as existing ones.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The re-use of patient data from electronic healthcare record systems can provide tremendous benefits for clinical research, but measures to protect patient privacy while utilizing these records have many challenges. Some of these challenges arise from a misperception that the problem should be solved technically when actually the problem needs a holistic solution.
OBJECTIVE: The authors' experience with informatics for integrating biology and the bedside (i2b2) use cases indicates that the privacy of the patient should be considered on three fronts: technical de-identification of the data, trust in the researcher and the research, and the security of the underlying technical platforms.
METHODS: The security structure of i2b2 is implemented based on consideration of all three fronts. It has been supported with several use cases across the USA, resulting in five privacy categories of users that serve to protect the data while supporting the use cases.
RESULTS: The i2b2 architecture is designed to provide consistency and faithfully implement these user privacy categories. These privacy categories help reflect the policy of both the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the provisions of the National Research Act of 1974, as embodied by current institutional review boards.
CONCLUSION: By implementing a holistic approach to patient privacy solutions, i2b2 is able to help close the gap between principle and practice.},

In this sense, the FAIR4­ Health project aimed to apply the FAIR principles in the health research field. For this purpose, a workflow and a set of tools were developed to apply FAIR principles in health research datasets, and validated through the demonstration of the potential impact that this strategy has on health research management outcomes.
Objective: This paper aims to describe the analysis of the impact on health research management outcomes of the FAIR4Health solution.
Methods: To analyse the impact on health research management outcomes in terms of time and economic savings, a survey was designed and sent to experts on data management with expertise in the use of the FAIR4Health solution. Then, differences between the time and costs needed to perform the techniques with (i) standalone research, and (ii) using the proposed solution, were analyzed.
Results: In the context of the health research management outcomes, the survey analysis concluded that 56.57\% of the time and 16800 EUR per month could be saved if the FAIR4Health solution is used.
Conclusions: Adopting principles in health research through the FAIR4Health solution saves time and, consequently, costs in the execution of research involving data management techniques.},

Research data management is the basis for efficiency, continuity, and quality of the research, as well as for maximum impact and outreach, including the long-term publication of data and their accessibility. Both funding agencies and publishers increasingly require this long term and open access to research data. Joint environmental studies typically take place in a fragmented research landscape of diverse disciplines; researchers involved typically show a variety of attitudes towards and previous experiences with common data policies, and the extensive variety of data types in interdisciplinary research poses particular challenges for collaborative data management. In this paper, we present organizational measures, data and metadata management concepts, and technical solutions to form a flexible research data management framework that allows for efficiently sharing the full range of data and metadata among all researchers of the project, and smooth publishing of selected data and data streams to publicly accessible sites. The concept is built upon data type-specific and hierarchical metadata using a common taxonomy agreed upon by all researchers of the project. The framework’s concept has been developed along the needs and demands of the scientists involved, and aims to minimize their effort in data management, which we illustrate from the researchers’ perspective describing their typical workflow from the generation and preparation of data and metadata to the long-term preservation of data including their metadata.},

	abstract = {Background
This study aims to review the literature regarding the barriers to sampling, recruitment, participation, and retention of members of socioeconomically disadvantaged groups in health research and strategies for increasing the amount of health research conducted with socially disadvantaged groups.

Methods
A systematic review with narrative synthesis was conducted. Searches of electronic databases Medline, PsychInfo, EMBASE, Social Science Index via Web of Knowledge and CINHAL were conducted for English language articles published up to May 2013. Qualitative and quantitative studies as well as literature reviews were included. Articles were included if they reported attempts to increase disadvantaged group participation in research, or the barriers to research with disadvantaged groups. Groups of interest were those described as socially, culturally or financially disadvantaged compared to the majority of society. Eligible articles were categorised according to five phases of research: 1) sampling, 2) recruitment and gaining consent, 3) data collection and measurement, 4) intervention delivery and uptake, and 5) retention and attrition.

Results
In total, 116 papers from 115 studies met inclusion criteria and 31 previous literature reviews were included. A comprehensive summation of the major barriers to working with various disadvantaged groups is provided, along with proposed strategies for addressing each of the identified types of barriers. Most studies of strategies to address the barriers were of a descriptive nature and only nine studies reported the results of randomised trials.

Conclusions
To tackle the challenges of research with socially disadvantaged groups, and increase their representation in health and medical research, researchers and research institutions need to acknowledge extended timeframes, plan for higher resourcing costs and operate via community partnerships.},

	abstract = {Qualitative research is a type of research that explores and provides deeper insights into real-world problems. Instead of collecting numerical data points or intervening or introducing treatments just like in quantitative research, qualitative research helps generate hypothenar to further investigate and understand quantitative data. Qualitative research gathers participants' experiences, perceptions, and behavior. It answers the hows and whys instead of how many or how much. It could be structured as a standalone study, purely relying on qualitative data, or part of mixed-methods research that combines qualitative and quantitative data. This review introduces the readers to some basic concepts, definitions, terminology, and applications of qualitative research. Qualitative research, at its core, asks open-ended questions whose answers are not easily put into numbers, such as "how" and "why." Due to the open-ended nature of the research questions, qualitative research design is often not linear like quantitative design. One of the strengths of qualitative research is its ability to explain processes and patterns of human behavior that can be difficult to quantify. Phenomena such as experiences, attitudes, and behaviors can be complex to capture accurately and quantitatively. In contrast, a qualitative approach allows participants themselves to explain how, why, or what they were thinking, feeling, and experiencing at a particular time or during an event of interest. Quantifying qualitative data certainly is possible, but at its core, qualitative data is looking for themes and patterns that can be difficult to quantify, and it is essential to ensure that the context and narrative of qualitative work are not lost by trying to quantify something that is not meant to be quantified. However, while qualitative research is sometimes placed in opposition to quantitative research, where they are necessarily opposites and therefore "compete" against each other and the philosophical paradigms associated with each other, qualitative and quantitative work are neither necessarily opposites, nor are they incompatible. While qualitative and quantitative approaches are different, they are not necessarily opposites and certainly not mutually exclusive. For instance, qualitative research can help expand and deepen understanding of data or results obtained from quantitative analysis. For example, say a quantitative analysis has determined a correlation between length of stay and level of patient satisfaction, but why does this correlation exist? This dual-focus scenario shows one way in which qualitative and quantitative research could be integrated.},

	abstract = {Much attention has been given to the challenges of handling massive data volumes in modern data-intensive science. This paper examines an equally daunting challenge – the diversity of interdisciplinary data, notably research data, and the need to interrelate these data to understand complex systemic problems such as environmental change and its impact. We use the experience of the International Polar Year 2007–8 (IPY) as a case study to examine data management approaches seeking to address issues around complex interdisciplinary science. We find that, while technology is a critical factor in addressing the interdisciplinary dimension of the data intensive science, the technologies developing for exa-scale data volumes differ from those that are needed for extremely distributed and heterogeneous data. Research data will continue to be highly heterogeneous and distributed and will require technologies to be much simpler and more flexible. More importantly, there is a need for both technical and cultural adaptation. We describe a vision of discoverable, open, linked, useful, and safe collections of data, organized and curated using the best principles and practices of information and library science. This vision provides a framework for our discussion and leads us to suggest several short- and long-term strategies to facilitate a socio-technical evolution in the overall science data ecosystem.},

          To present an overview of the impact of climate change upon human respiratory health.
          Recent findings 
          Climate change involves two major types of change. First, there is overall progressive warming. Second, there is increased variability/unpredictability in weather patterns. Both types of change impact negatively upon human respiratory health. Worsening air quality and increased allergens can worsen existing disease. Climate-related changes in allergens and in vectors for infection can cause new disease. Redundant sophisticated studies have projected marked increases in respiratory morbidity and mortality throughout the world as a direct result of climate change. This article summarizes some of those studies.
          Summary 
          The clarity of our vision with respect to the dramatic impact of climate change upon human respiratory health approaches 20/20. The data represent a mandate for change. Change needs to include international, national, and individual efforts.},

	abstract = {Background
Whether ambient temperature exposure contributes to death from asthma remains unknown to date. We therefore conducted a case-crossover study in China to quantitatively evaluate the association and burden of ambient temperature exposure on asthma mortality.
Methods
Using data from the National Mortality Surveillance System in China, we conducted a time-stratified case-crossover study of 15 888 individuals who lived in Hubei and Jiangsu province, China and died from asthma as the underlying cause in 2015–2019. Individual-level exposures to air temperature and apparent temperature on the date of death and 21 days prior were assessed based on each subject's residential address. Distributed lag nonlinear models based on conditional logistic regression were used to quantify exposure-response associations and calculate fraction and number of deaths attributable to non-optimum ambient temperatures.
Results
We observed a reverse J-shaped association between air temperature and risk of asthma mortality, with a minimum mortality temperature of 21.3 °C. Non-optimum ambient temperature is responsible for substantial excess mortality from asthma. In total, 26.3\% of asthma mortality were attributable to non-optimum temperatures, with moderate cold, moderate hot, extreme cold and extreme hot responsible for 21.7\%, 2.4\%, 2.1\% and 0.9\% of asthma mortality, respectively. The total attributable fraction and number was significantly higher among adults aged less than 80 years in hot temperature.
Conclusions
Exposure to non-optimum ambient temperature, especially moderate cold temperature, was responsible for substantial excess mortality from asthma. These findings have important implications for planning of public-health interventions to minimize the adverse respiratory damage from non-optimum ambient temperature.},

Based on geographical and socioeconomics characteristics, this study divided the whole island into seven areas. A distributed lag non-linear model was used to estimate the area-disease-specific cumulative relative risk (RR), and random-effect meta-analysis was used to estimate the pooled RR of outpatient visits, from lag 0 to lag 7 days, associated with daily temperature, and added effects of prolonged extreme heat and cold for population of all ages, the elderly and younger than 65 years. Pooled analyses showed that younger population had higher outpatient visits for exposing to low temperature of 18 °C, with cumulative 8-day RRs of 1.36 (95 \% confidence interval (CI) 1.31–1.42) for respiratory diseases, 1.10 (95 \% CI 1.03–1.18) for asthma, and 1.12 (95 \% CI 1.02–1.22) for CAO. The elderly was more vulnerable to high temperature of 30 °C with the cumulative 8-day RR of 1.08 (95 \% CI 1.03–1.13) for CAO. Elevated outpatient visits for all respiratory diseases and asthma were associated with extreme heat lasting for 6 to 8 days. On the contrary, the extreme cold lasting more than 8 days had significant negative association with outpatient visits of all respiratory diseases. In summary, elderly patients of respiratory diseases and CAO are vulnerable to high temperature. Cold temperature is associated with all types of respiratory diseases for younger patients.},

	abstract = {Background
There is rapidly growing evidence indicating that extreme temperature is a crucial trigger and potential activator of asthma; however, the effects of extreme temperature on asthma are inconsistently reported and the its potential mechanisms remain undefined.
Objectives
This review aims to estimate the impacts of extreme heat, extreme cold, and temperature variations on asthma by systematically summarizing the existing studies from epidemiological evidence to biological plausibility.
Methods
We conducted a systematic search in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science from inception to June 30, 2022, and we retrieved articles of epidemiology and biological studies which assessed associations between extreme temperatures and asthma. This protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021273613).
Results
From 12,435 identified records, 111 eligible studies were included in the qualitative synthesis, and 37 articles were included in the meta-analysis (20 for extreme heat, 16 for extreme cold, and 15 for temperature variations). For epidemiological evidence, we found that the synergistic effects of extreme temperatures, indoor/outdoor environments, and individual vulnerabilities are important triggers for asthma attacks, especially when there is extreme heat or cold. Meta-analysis further confirmed the associations, and the pooled relative risks for asthma attacks in extreme heat and extreme cold were 1.07 (95\%CI: 1.03–1.12) and 1.20 (95\%CI: 1.12–1.29), respectively. Additionally, this review discussed the potential inflammatory mechanisms behind the associations between extreme temperatures and asthma exacerbation, and highlighted the regulatory role of immunological pathways and transient receptor potential ion channels in asthma triggered by extreme temperatures.
Conclusions
We concluded that both extreme heat and cold could significantly increase the risk of asthma. Additionally, we proposed a potential mechanistic framework, which is important for understanding the disease pathogenesis that uncovers the complex mechanisms of asthma triggered by extreme temperatures and protects the sensitive individuals from impacts of extreme weather events and climate change.},

	abstract = {Association between short-term exposure to ambient air pollution and respiratory health is well documented. At the same time, it is widely known that extreme weather events intrinsically exacerbate air pollution impact. Particularly, hot weather and extreme temperatures during heat waves (HW) significantly affect human health, increasing risks of respiratory mortality and morbidity. Concurrently, a synergistic effect of air pollution and high temperatures can be combined with weather–air pollution interaction during wildfires. The purpose of the current review is to summarize literature on interplay of hot weather, air pollution, and respiratory health consequences worldwide, with the ultimate goal of identifying the most dangerous pollution agents and vulnerable population groups. A literature search was conducted using electronic databases Web of Science, Pubmed, Science Direct, and Scopus, focusing only on peer-reviewed journal articles published in English from 2000 to 2021. The main findings demonstrate that the increased level of PM10 and O3 results in significantly higher rates of respiratory and cardiopulmonary mortality. Increments in PM2.5 and PM10, O3, CO, and NO2 concentrations during high temperature episodes are dramatically associated with higher admissions to hospital in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, daily hospital emergency transports for asthma, acute and chronic bronchitis, and premature mortality caused by respiratory disease. Excessive respiratory health risk is more pronounced in elderly cohorts and small children. Both heat waves and outdoor air pollution are synergistically linked and are expected to be more serious in the future due to greater climate instability, being a crucial threat to global public health that requires the responsible involvement of researchers at all levels. Sustainable urban planning and smart city design could significantly reduce both urban heat islands effect and air pollution.},

	abstract = {Background
Asthma, the second leading cause of death from chronic respiratory diseases, is associated with climate change, especially temperature changes. It is currently unclear about the relationship between long-term temperature variability and the incidence of asthma on a global scale.
Methods
We used asthma incidence, demographic and socioeconomic data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Results Database, and environmental and geographical statistics from TerraClimate between 1990 and 2019 to determine the association between maximum temperature variability and asthma incidence. We also predicted the incidence of heat-related asthma in the future (2020−2100) under four shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs: 126, 245, 370, and 585).
Results
Between 1990 and 2019, the global median incidence of asthma was 402.0 per 100,000 with a higher incidence (median: 1380.3 per 100,000) in children under 10 years old. We found that every 1 °C increase in maximum temperature variability increased the risk of asthma globally by 5.0 \%, and the effect was robust for individuals living in high-latitude areas or aged from 50 to 70 years. By 2100, the average incidence of asthma is estimated to be reduced by 95.55 \%, 79.32 \%, and 40.02 \% under the SSP126, SSP245, and SSP370 scenarios, respectively, compared to the SSP585 at latitudes {\textgreater}60°.
Conclusion
Our study provides evidence that maximum temperature variability is associated with asthma incidence. These findings suggest that implementing stricter mitigation and adaptation strategies may be importment in reducing asthma cases caused by climate change.},

This study applied a time series analysis with data extracted from the electronic database of provincial hospitals and meteorological stations from the corresponding province. To eliminate over-dispersion, this time series analysis used Quasi-Poisson regression. The models were controlled for the day of the week, holiday, time trend, and relative humidity. Heatwaves were defined as the maximum temperature exceeding P90th over the period from 2010 to 2018 during at least three consecutive days. Data from 31,191 hospital admissions for respiratory diseases and 29,056 hospitalizations for cardiovascular diseases were investigated in the two provinces. Associations between hospital admissions for respiratory diseases and heatwaves in Ninh Thuan were observed at lag 2, with excess risk (ER = 8.31\%, 95\% confidence interval: 0.64–16.55\%). However, heatwaves were negatively associated with cardiovascular diseases in Ca Mau, which was determined amongst the elderly (age above 60), ER = −7.28\%, 95\%CI: −13.97–−0.08\%. Heatwaves can be a risk factor for hospital admission due to respiratory diseases in Vietnam. Further studies need to be conducted to assert the link between heat waves and cardiovascular diseases.},

The results show that research collaboration at the author and country/region levels has significantly positive effects on variety and DIV (an integrated diversity indicator), although these effects are limited. Additionally, the associations between the values of variety, disparity, and DIV and the number of departments are significantly positive, and similar results are found regarding relationships between these indicators and the number of countries/regions at the country/region and integrated levels. However, scientific collaboration has a negative effect on the balance of references at all levels.

This movement has supported growth in fields, such as artificial intelligence (AI), which has demonstrated potential to accelerate science, engineering, and medicine in new and exciting ways. To further advance innovation around these new approaches, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine's Board on Research Data and Information convened a public virtual workshop on October 14-15, 2020, to address how researchers in different domains are utilizing data that undergo repeated processing, often in real-time, to accelerate scientific discovery. Although these topics were not originally part of the workshop, the impact of COVID-19 prompted the planning committee to add sessions on early career researchers' perspectives, as well as rapid review and publishing activities as a result of the pandemic. Participants also explored the advances needed to enable future progress in areas such as AI, cyberinfrastructure, standards, and policies. This publication summarizes the presentations and discussion of the workshop.},

The emphasis in the past has been on balancing the risks to individuals with the benefit to society of the use of databases for research. However, a new way of looking at such issues is that by optimising procedures and policies regarding security and privacy of data to the extent that there is no appreciable risk to the privacy of individuals, we can create a ‘win–win’ situation in which everyone benefits, and pharmacoepidemiological research can flourish with public support. We discuss holistic measures, involving both information technology and people, taken to improve the security and privacy of data storage. Methods After an internal review, we commissioned an external audit by an independent consultant with a view to optimising our data storage and handling procedures. Results Improvements to our policies and procedures were implemented as a result of the audit. Conclusions By optimising our storage of data, we hope to inspire public confidence and hence cooperation with the use of health care data in research. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Most UK National Health Service (NHS) care interactions are recorded in electronic health records, resulting in an unmatched potential for population-level datasets.

In response, we used public information sources to map all electronic patient data flows across England, from providers to more than 460 subsequent academic, commercial, and public data consumers. Although NHS data support a global research ecosystem, we found that multistage data flow chains limit transparency and risk public trust, most data interactions do not fulfil recommended best practices for safe data access, and existing infrastructure produces aggregation of duplicate data assets, thus limiting diversity of data and added value to end users. We provide recommendations to support data infrastructure transformation and have produced a website (https://DataInsights.uk) to promote transparency and showcase NHS data assets.},

This study attempted to determine the seasonality and association of air pollution, in addition to climate conditions, with two respiratory infections, influenza and pneumonia, in Chiang Mai, Thailand, which has been considered the most polluted city on Earth during the hot season. We used a seasonal-trend decomposition procedure based on loess regression (STL) and a seasonal cycle subseries (SCS) plot to determine the seasonality of the two diseases. In addition, multivariable negative binomial regression (NBR) models were used to assess the association between the diseases and environmental variables (temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, PM2.5, and PM10). The data revealed that influenza had a clear seasonal pattern during the cold months of January and February, whereas the incidence of pneumonia showed a weak seasonal pattern. In terms of forecasting, the preceding month’s PM2.5 and temperature (lag1) had a significant association with influenza incidence, while the previous month’s temperature and relative humidity influenced pneumonia. Using air pollutants as an indication of respiratory disease, our models indicated that PM2.5 lag1 was correlated with the incidence of influenza, but not pneumonia. However, there was a linear association between PM10 and both diseases. This research will help in allocating clinical and public health resources in response to potential environmental changes and forecasting the future dynamics of influenza and pneumonia in the region due to air pollution.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Asthma, the second leading cause of death from chronic respiratory diseases, is associated with climate change, especially temperature changes. It is currently unclear about the relationship between long-term temperature variability and the incidence of asthma on a global scale.
METHODS: We used asthma incidence, demographic and socioeconomic data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Results Database, and environmental and geographical statistics from TerraClimate between 1990 and 2019 to determine the association between maximum temperature variability and asthma incidence. We also predicted the incidence of heat-related asthma in the future (2020-2100) under four shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs: 126, 245, 370, and 585).
RESULTS: Between 1990 and 2019, the global median incidence of asthma was 402.0 per 100,000 with a higher incidence (median: 1380.3 per 100,000) in children under 10 years old. We found that every 1 °C increase in maximum temperature variability increased the risk of asthma globally by 5.0 \%, and the effect was robust for individuals living in high-latitude areas or aged from 50 to 70 years. By 2100, the average incidence of asthma is estimated to be reduced by 95.55 \%, 79.32 \%, and 40.02 \% under the SSP126, SSP245, and SSP370 scenarios, respectively, compared to the SSP585 at latitudes {\textgreater}60°.
CONCLUSION: Our study provides evidence that maximum temperature variability is associated with asthma incidence. These findings suggest that implementing stricter mitigation and adaptation strategies may be importment in reducing asthma cases caused by climate change.},

The first component is an environmental epidemiology study comprised of three sub-studies: (i) a global climate model (GCM) simulating specific health-sector climate indices; (ii) a time-series study to estimate the risk of childhood respiratory disease attributable to ambient air pollution; and (iii) a case-crossover study to identify the association between haze and under-five mortality in Malaysia. The GCM found that Malaysia has been experiencing increasing rainfall intensity over the years, leading to increased incidences of other weather-related events. The time-series study revealed that air quality has worsened, while air pollution and haze have been linked to an increased risk of hospitalization for respiratory diseases among children. Although no clear association between haze and under-five mortality was found in the case-crossover study, the lag patterns suggested that health effects could be more acute if haze occurred over a longer duration and at a higher intensity. The second component consists of three community surveys on marginalized children conducted (i) among the island community of Pulau Gaya, Sabah; (ii) among the indigenous Temiar tribe in Pos Kuala Mu, Perak; and (iii) among an urban poor community (B40) in PPR Sg. Bonus, Kuala Lumpur. The community surveys are cross-sectional studies employing a socio-ecological approach using a standardized questionnaire. The community surveys revealed how children adapt to climate change and environmental degradation. An integrated model was established that consolidates our overall research processes and demonstrates the crucial interconnections between environmental challenges exacerbated by climate change. It is recommended that Malaysian schools adopt a climate-smart approach to education to instill awareness of the impending climate change and its cascading impact on children's health from early school age.},

We aimed to examine the excess emergency department (ED) visits related to the 2019–20 bushfires in New South Wales (NSW). We obtained weekly data of ED visits for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases in all the 28 Statistical Area Level 4 (SA4) regions in NSW during the bushfire seasons from 2017 to 2020. A two-stage interrupted time-series analysis was applied to quantify the excess risk for ED visits in 2019–20. The total number of excess ED visits, excess percentages, and their empirical confidence intervals (eCIs) were calculated to estimate the impacts of the bushfire season. A total of 416,057 records of cardiorespiratory ED visits were included in our analysis. The bushfire season in 2019–20 was significantly associated with a 6.0\% increase (95\% eCI: 1.9, 10.3) in ED visits for respiratory diseases and a 10.0\% increase (95\% eCI: 5.0, 15.2) for cardiovascular diseases, corresponding to 6177 (95\% eCI: 1989, 10,166) and 3120 (95\% eCI: 1628, 4544) excess ED visits, respectively. The percentage of excess ED visits was higher in regions with lower SES and high fire density. In the context of climate change, more targeted strategies should be developed to prevent adverse bushfire effects and recover from such extreme environmental events.},

	abstract = {Background
Climate change plays a significant role in global health threats, particularly with respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma, but the long-term global-scale impact of climate change on these diseases' mortality remains unclear.
Objective
This study aims to investigate the impact of climate change on the age-standardized mortality rates (ASMR) of COPD and asthma at national levels.
Methods
We used Global Burden of Disease (GBD) data of ASMR of COPD and asthma from 2000 to 2018. The climate change index was represented as the deviance percentage of temperature (DPT) and relative humidity (DPRH), calculated based on 19-year temperature and humidity averages. Annual temperature, RH, and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) levels in 185 countries/regions were obtained from ERA5 and the OECD's environmental statistics database. General linear mixed-effect regression models were used to examine the associations between climate change with the log of ASMR (LASMR) of COPD and asthma.
Results
After adjusting for annual PM2.5, SDI level, smoking prevalence, and geographical regions, a 0.26\% increase in DPT was associated with decreases of 0.016, 0.017, and 0.014 per 100,000 people in LASMR of COPD and 0.042, 0.046, and 0.040 per 100,000 people in LASMR of asthma for both genders, males, and females. A 2.68\% increase in DPRH was associated with increases of 0.009 and 0.011 per 100,000 people in LASMR of COPD. We observed a negative association of DPT with LASMR for COPD in countries/regions with temperatures ranging from 3.8 to 29.9 °C and with LASMR for asthma ranging from −5.3–29.9 °C. However, we observed a positive association of DPRH with LASMR for both COPD and asthma in the RH range of 41.2–67.2\%.
Conclusion
Climate change adaptation and mitigation could be crucial in reducing the associated COPD and asthma mortality rates, particularly in regions most vulnerable to temperature and humidity fluctuations.},

Abstract
Climate change affects human health, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) incidence is one of the health impacts of climate change. This study is a retrospective cohort study. Data have been collected from the Iranian Ministry of Health and Medical Education between 17 February 2016 and17 February 2018. The Neural Network Model has been used to predict SARS infection. Based on the results of the multivariate Poisson regression and the analysis of the coexistence of the variables, the minimum daily temperature was positively associated with the risk of SARS in men and women. The risk of SARS has increased in women and men with increasing daily rainfall. According to the result, by changes in bioclimatic parameters, the number of SARS patients will be increased in cities of Iran. Our study has shown a significant relationship between SARS and the climatic variables by the type of climate and gender. The estimates suggest that hospital admissions for climate-related respiratory diseases in Iran will increase by 36\% from 2020 to 2050. This study demonstrates one of the health impacts of climate change. Policymakers can control the risks of climate change by mitigation and adaptation strategists.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Substantial evidence suggests that non-optimal temperatures can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality and morbidity; however, limited studies have reported inconsistent results for hospital admissions depending on study locations, which also lack national-level investigations on cause-specific CVDs.
METHODS: We performed a two-stage meta-regression analysis to examine the short-term associations between temperature and acute CVD hospital admissions by specific categories [i.e., ischemic heart disease (IHD), heart failure (HF), and stroke] in 47 prefectures of Japan from 2011 to 2018. First, we estimated the prefecture-specific associations using a time-stratified case-crossover design with a distributed lag nonlinear model. We then used a multivariate meta-regression model to obtain national average associations.
RESULTS: During the study period, a total of 4,611,984 CVD admissions were reported. We found cold temperatures significantly increased the risk of total CVD admissions and cause-specific categories. Compared with the minimum hospitalization temperature (MHT) at the 98th percentile of temperature (29.9 °C), the cumulative relative risks (RRs) for cold (5th percentile, 1.7 °C) and heat (99th percentile, 30.5 °C) on total CVD were 1.226 [95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.195, 1.258] and 1.000 (95\% CI: 0.998, 1.002), respectively. The RR for cold on HF [RR = 1.571 (95\% CI: 1.487, 1.660)] was higher than those of IHD [RR = 1.119 (95\% CI: 1.040, 1.204)] and stroke [RR = 1.107 (95\% CI: 1.062, 1.155)], comparing to their cause-specific MHTs. We also observed that extreme heat increased the risk of HF with RR of 1.030 (95\% CI: 1.007, 1.054). Subgroup analysis showed that the age group ≥85 years was more vulnerable to these non-optimal temperature risks.
CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated that cold and heat exposure could increase the risk of hospital admissions for CVD, varying depending on the cause-specific categories, which may provide new evidence to reduce the burden of CVD.},

Human activities have increased atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases. Change in climate and the correlated global warming affects the quantity, intensity, and frequency of precipitation type as well as the frequency of extreme events such as heat waves, droughts, thunderstorms, floods, and hurricanes. Respiratory health can be particularly affected by climate change, which contributes to the development of allergic respiratory diseases and asthma. Pollen and mold allergens are able to trigger the release of pro-inflammatory and immunomodulatory mediators that accelerate the onset the IgE-mediated sensitization and of allergy. Allergy to pollen and pollen season at its beginning, in duration and intensity are altered by climate change. Studies showed that plants exhibit enhanced photosynthesis and reproductive effects and produce more pollen as a response to high atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide (CO2). Mold proliferation is increased by floods and rainy storms are responsible for severe asthma. Pollen and mold allergy is generally used to evaluate the interrelation between air pollution and allergic respiratory diseases, such as rhinitis and asthma. Thunderstorms during pollen seasons can cause exacerbation of respiratory allergy and asthma in patients with hay fever. A similar phenomenon is observed for molds. Measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions can have positive health benefits.},

	abstract = {Background
Hurricane Katrina made landfall in New Orleans, Louisiana as a Category 3 storm in August 2005. Storm surges, levee failures, and the low-lying nature of New Orleans led to widespread flooding, damage to over 70\% of occupied housing, and evacuation of 80–90\% of city residents. Only 57\% of the city's black population has returned. Many residents complain of gentrification following rebuilding efforts. Climate gentrification is a recently described phenomenon whereby the effects of climate change, most notably rising sea levels and more frequent flooding and storm surges, alter housing values in a way that leads to gentrification.
Objective
To examine the climate gentrification following hurricane Katrina by (1) estimating the associations between flooding severity, ground elevation, and gentrification and (2) whether these relationships are modified by neighborhood level pre- and post-storm sociodemographic factors.
Methods
Lidar data collected in 2002 were used to determine elevation. Water gauge height of Lake Ponchartrain was used to estimate flood depth. Using census tracts as a proxy for neighborhoods, demographic, housing, and economic data from the 2000 decennial census and the 2010 and 2015 American Community Survey 5-year estimates US Census records were used to determine census tracts considered eligible for gentrification (median income {\textless} 2000 Orleans Parish median income). A gentrification index was created using tract changes in education level, population above the poverty limit, and median household income. Proportional odds ordinal logistic regression was used with product terms to test for effect measure modification by sociodemographic factors.
Results
Census tracts eligible for gentrification in 2000 were 80.2\% black. Median census tract flood depth was significantly lower in areas eligible to undergo gentrification (0.70 m vs. 1.03 m). Residents of gentrification-eligible tracts in 2000 were significantly more likely to be black, less educated, lower income, unemployed, and rent their home rather than own. In 2015 in these same eligible tracts, areas that underwent gentrification became significantly whiter, more educated, higher income, less unemployed, and more likely to live in a multi-unit dwelling. Gentrification was inversely associated with flood depth and directly associated with ground elevation in eligible tracts. Marginal effect modification was detected by the effect of pre-storm black race on the relationships of flood depth and elevation with gentrification.
Conclusions
Gentrification was strongly associated with higher ground elevation in New Orleans. These results provide evidence to support the idea of climate gentrification described in other low-elevation major metropolitan areas like Miami, FL. High elevation, low-income, demographically transitional areas in particular – that is areas that more closely resemble high-income area demographics, may be vulnerable to future climate gentrification.},

Human relocation and resettlement in the wake of sea level rise are subject to elevation, proximity to coasts, and the resilience of communities, possibly leading to the change of socioeconomic profiles of neighbourhoods and the emergence of a new urban phenomenon termed climate gentrification. This study aims to propose a tri-disciplinary conceptual framework integrating social, environmental, and urban sciences to explore the potential existence of climate gentrification. Through an empirical study in a coastal city of Gold Coast, Australia, we first identify suburbs that are undergoing gentrification based on demographic and socioeconomic indicators. We then statistically test whether the level of gentrification is associated with the built environment and natural environment factors, in particular, the level of risk to sea level rise. The empirical findings show that the multi-dimensional determinants of social, built and natural environment features collectively affect the potential formation and spatial evolution of climate gentrification in this rapidly evolving coastal city through its push and pull effects. Our study contributes to ongoing literature by conceptualising as well as operationalising a multi-dimensional framework to study the emerging climate gentrification phenomenon.},

Different projects and initiatives have attempted to address this challenge from various points of view, which are not easily comparable.Objectives: This paper aims to clarify the challenges, concepts, and approaches involved, which is essential in order to consistently compare existing solutions and objectively assess progress in the field.Methods: This is achieved by two different means. Firstly, the paper will identify the most significant issues that differentiate the points of view and intended scope of existing approaches. As a result, a framework for analysis of EHR systems will be produced. Secondly, the most representative EHR-related projects and initiatives will be described and compared within the context of this framework.Results: The main result of the present paper is an analysis framework for EHR systems. This is intended as an initial step towards an attempt to structure research on this field, clearly lacking sound principles to evaluate and compare results, and ultimately focusing its efforts and being able to objectively evaluate scientific progress.Conclusions: Evaluation and comparison of results in medical informatics, and specifically EHR systems, must address technical and nontechnical aspects. It is challenging to condensate in a single framework all potential views of such a field, and any chosen approach is bound to have its limitations. That being said, any well structured comparison approach, such as the framework presented here, is better than no comparison framework at all, as has been the current situation to date. This paper has presented the first attempt known to the authors to define such a framework.},

Digital healthcare services have paved the way for easier and more accessible treatment, thus making our lives far more comfortable. However, the present day healthcare industry has also become the main victim of external as well as internal attacks. Data breaches are not just a concern and complication for security experts; they also affect clients, stakeholders, organizations, and businesses. Though the data breaches are of different types, their impact is almost always the same. This study provides insights into the various categories of data breaches faced by different organizations. The main objective is to do an in-depth analysis of healthcare data breaches and draw inferences from them, thereby using the findings to improve healthcare data confidentiality. The study found that hacking/IT incidents are the most prevalent forms of attack behind healthcare data breaches, followed by unauthorized internal disclosures. The frequency of healthcare data breaches, magnitude of exposed records, and financial losses due to breached records are increasing rapidly. Data from the healthcare industry is regarded as being highly valuable. This has become a major lure for the misappropriation and pilferage of healthcare data. Addressing this anomaly, the present study employs the simple moving average method and the simple exponential soothing method of time series analysis to examine the trend of healthcare data breaches and their cost. Of the two methods, the simple moving average method provided more reliable forecasting results.},

The issue of climate change has received comparatively little attention to date in the fields of sports science. Thus, sport-related health risks caused by climate change are discussed and summarized in a conceptual model presented here for the first time. Climate change is associated with the following increases of health-related risks for athletes in particular: Direct consequences caused by extreme temperature and other extreme weather events (e.g. increasing risks due to heatwaves, thunderstorms, floods, lightning, ultraviolet radiation) and indirect consequences as a result of climate-induced changes to our ecosystem (e.g. due to increased air pollution by ozone, higher exposures to allergens, increasing risks of infection by viruses and bacteria and the associated vectors and reservoir organisms). Each aspect is supplemented with advice on the prevention of health hazards. Not only individual athletes but also sports organizations and local clubs will have to respond to the changes in our climate, so that they can appropriately protect both athletes and spectators and ensure a plannable continuation of the sport in the future.},

To systematically develop an adaptation model to reduce climate change-related health risks for outdoor athletes.
Design
Delphi Method study.
Methods
A classic asynchronous Delphi study was conducted with a total of three survey rounds. 24 experts from the eight largest outdoor sport associations by membership in the German Olympic Sports Confederation were included as well as 24 medical experts with expertise in sport medicine, internal medicine, allergology, dermatology, infectiology, or toxicology. Based on open-ended questions, panelists were asked to consider prevention measures for sport organizations and clubs. Free text responses were analyzed by qualitative content analysis according to Mayring.
Results
Experts recommended establishing the following eight fields of prevention measures: technical and structural measures; organizational measures; personalized measures; basic, advanced, and continuing education; concepts of action, warning concepts, and financial concepts; cooperation and coordination; campaigns; and evaluation measures.
Conclusions
The pyramid model presented in this study systematizes possible sport-specific adaptation measures on climate change by empirical aggregation of knowledge from scientists, sport organizations, clubs, trainers, and professional athletes. To assess the effectiveness of these prevention measures, sport organizations may incorporate them not only into broader operations but also everyday training routines.},

Continuous efforts from sport sciences and exercise physiology communities aim at minimizing the risks of environmental-related illnesses during outdoor sports practices. Despite this, the use of simple weather indices does not permit an accurate estimation of the likelihood of facing thermal illnesses. This provides a critical foundation to modify available human comfort modeling and to integrate bio-meteorological data in order to improve the current guidelines. Although it requires further refinement, there is no doubt that standardizing the recently developed Universal Thermal Climate Index approach and its application in the field of sport sciences and exercise physiology may help to improve the appropriateness of the current guidelines for outdoor, recreational and competitive sports participation. This review first summarizes the main environmental-related risk factors that are susceptible to increase with recent climate changes when exercising outside and offers recommendations to combat them appropriately. Secondly, we briefly address the recent development of thermal stress models to assess the thermal comfort and physiological responses when practicing outdoor activities in challenging environments.},

This study presents a machine-learning-based outdoor thermal comfort model with a good trade-off between computational cost, complexity, and accuracy compared to common numerical urban climate models. The machine learning approach is basically an emulation of different numerical urban climate models. The final model consists of four submodels that predict air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and mean radiant temperature based on meteorological forcing and geospatial data on building forms, land cover, and vegetation. These variables are then combined into a thermal index (universal thermal climate index – UTCI). All four submodel predictions and the final model output are evaluated using street-level measurements from a dense urban sensor network in Freiburg, Germany. The final model has a mean absolute error of 2.3 K. Based on a city-wide simulation for Freiburg, we demonstrate that the model is fast and versatile enough to simulate multiple years at hourly time steps to predict street-level UTCI at 1 m spatial resolution for an entire city. Simulations indicate that neighbourhood-averaged thermal comfort conditions vary widely between neighbourhoods, even if they are attributed to the same local climate zones, for example, due to differences in age and degree of urban vegetation. Simulations also show contrasting differences in the location of hotspots during the day and at night.},

	abstract = {Long-term air pollution data are essential for formulating air quality management policies and assessing their corresponding impacts on public health. However, missing data are inevitably encountered during air pollution observations at different sites. This study proposed a machine learning approach that utilizes data from neighboring sites to reconstruct missing data. Hourly observation data from three neighboring sites in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region in South China, were used for data retrieval, including the NC site (2006–2015), JXL site and PYZX site (2014–2022). The overlapped data (2014.05–2015.12) were used to train and evaluate the machine learning models. The performance of 11 algorithms (CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM, LightGBMXT, LightGBMLarge, RandomForestMSE, ExtraTreeMSE, NeuralNetTorch, NeuralNetFastAI, KNeighborsDist, and KNeighborsUnif) for the retrieval of major air pollutants, including O3, NO2, PM2.5, PM10 and SO2 was benchmarked by a set of evaluation metrics. CatBoost showed the best performance; thus, it was adopted for air pollutant data reconstruction in NC (2016–2022) and PYZX (2008–2014). Long-term data (2006–2022) at the NC were obtained by combining the observation and retrieval data. In the past 15 years, the O3 concentration of NC has increased by 72\% at a rate of 0.83 ppb yr−1 (3.2\% yr−1). On the contrary, substantial reductions were observed for NO2 (61\%), PM2.5 (51\%) and PM10 (42\%) at the NC site, with the rates of −1.27 ppb yr−1 (−5.9\% yr−1), −1.96 μg m−3 yr−1 (−5.8\% yr−1) and −2.32 μg m−3 yr−1 (−5.2\% yr−1), respectively. SO2 exhibits the most pronounced reduction (79\%) among all species, with two distinct rates of −4.10 ppb yr−1 (−27.4\% yr−1) and −0.40 ppb yr−1 (−6.2\% yr−1), for 2008–2012 and 2012–2022, respectively. This study demonstrates the feasibility of machine learning in filling the data gap of air pollution monitoring network and highlights the importance of continuous long-term air pollution data in reviewing air quality management policies.},

	abstract = {Ultrafine particles (UFPs) are airborne particles with a diameter of less than 100 nm. They are emitted from various sources, such as traffic, combustion, and industrial processes, and can have adverse effects on human health. Long-term mean ambient average particle size (APS) in the UFP range varies over space within cities, with locations near UFP sources having typically smaller APS. Spatial models for lung deposited surface area (LDSA) within urban areas are limited and currently there is no model for APS in any European city. We collected particle number concentration (PNC), LDSA, and APS data over one-year monitoring campaign from May 2021 to May 2022 across 27 locations and estimated annual mean in Copenhagen, Denmark, and obtained additionally annual mean PNC data from 6 state-owned continuous monitors. We developed 94 predictor variables, and machine learning models (random forest and bagged tree) were developed for PNC, LDSA, and APS. The annual mean PNC, LDSA, and APS were, respectively, 5523 pt/cm3, 12.0 μm2/cm3, and 46.1 nm. The final R2 values by random forest (RF) model were 0.93 for PNC, 0.88 for LDSA, and 0.85 for APS. The 10-fold, repeated 10-times cross-validation R2 values were 0.65, 0.67, and 0.60 for PNC, LDSA, and APS, respectively. The root mean square error for final RF models were 296 pt/cm3, 0.48 μm2/cm3, and 1.60 nm for PNC, LDSA, and APS, respectively. Traffic-related variables, such as length of major roads within buffers 100–150 m and distance to streets with various speed limits were amongst the highly-ranked predictors for our models. Overall, our ML models achieved high R2 values and low errors, providing insights into UFP exposure in a European city where average PNC is quite low. These hyperlocal predictions can be used to study health effects of UFPs in the Danish Capital.},

	doi = {10.1186/1476-072X-5-58},
	abstract = {Background
While the use of spatially referenced data for the analysis of epidemiological data is growing, issues associated with selecting the appropriate geographic unit of analysis are also emerging. A particularly problematic unit is the ZIP code. Lacking standardization and highly dynamic in structure, the use of ZIP codes and ZIP code tabulation areas (ZCTA) for the spatial analysis of disease present a unique challenge to researchers. Problems associated with these units for detecting spatial patterns of disease are explored.

Results
A brief review of ZIP codes and their spatial representation is conducted. Though frequently represented as polygons to facilitate analysis, ZIP codes are actually defined at a narrower spatial resolution reflecting the street addresses they serve. This research shows that their generalization as continuous regions is an imposed structure that can have serious implications in the interpretation of research results. ZIP codes areas and Census defined ZCTAs, two commonly used polygonal representations of ZIP code address ranges, are examined in an effort to identify the spatial statistical sensitivities that emerge given differences in how these representations are defined. Here, comparative analysis focuses on the detection of patterns of prostate cancer in New York State. Of particular interest for studies utilizing local, spatial statistical tests, is that differences in the topological structures of ZIP code areas and ZCTAs give rise to different spatial patterns of disease. These differences are related to the different methodologies used in the generalization of ZIP code information. Given the difficulty associated with generating ZIP code boundaries, both ZIP code areas and ZCTAs contain numerous representational errors which can have a significant impact on spatial analysis. While the use of ZIP code polygons for spatial analysis is relatively straightforward, ZCTA representations contain additional topological features (e.g. lakes and rivers) and contain fragmented polygons that can hinder spatial analysis.

Conclusion
Caution must be exercised when using spatially referenced data, particularly that which is attributed to ZIP codes and ZCTAs, for epidemiological analysis. Researchers should be cognizant of representational errors associated with both geographies and their resulting spatial mismatch, especially when comparing the results obtained using different topological representations. While ZCTAs can be problematic, topological corrections are easily implemented in a geographic information system to remedy erroneous aggregation effects.},

As of May 2022, over 6 million people died as a result of COVID-19 and over 500 million conﬁrmed cases, with many COVID-19 survivors going on to experience long-term effects weeks, months, or years after their illness. Despite this staggering toll, those who work with pandemic-relevant data often face signiﬁcant systemic barriers to accessing, sharing or re-using this data. In this paper we report results of a study, where we interviewed data professionals working with COVID-19-relevant data types including social media, mobility, viral genome, testing, infection, hospital admission, and deaths. These data types are variously used for pandemic spread modelling, healthcare system strain awareness, and devising therapeutic treatments for COVID-19. Barriers to data access, sharing and re-use include the cost of access to data (primarily certain healthcare sources and mobility data from mobile phone carriers), human throughput bottlenecks, unclear pathways to request access to data, unnecessarily strict access controls and data re-use policies, unclear data provenance, inability to link separate data sources that could collectively create a more complete picture, poor adherence to metadata standards, and a lack of computer-suitable data formats.},

At present, there is a poor understanding of the role of IT in this process, specifically regarding the management of patient data, clinical communication, and workflow support.

Objective
To apply data journey modeling to better understand interoperability, data access, and workflow requirements of a regional multicenter kidney transplant service.

Methods
An incremental methodology was used to develop the data journey model. This included review of service documents, domain expert interviews, and iterative modeling sessions. Results were analyzed based on the LOAD (landscape, organizations, actors, and data) framework to provide a meaningful assessment of current data management challenges and inform ways for IT to overcome these challenges.

Results
Results were presented as a diagram of the organizations (n=4), IT systems (n{\textgreater}9), actors (n{\textgreater}4), and data journeys (n=0) involved in the transplant referral pathway. The diagram revealed that all movement of data was dependent on actor interaction with IT systems and manual transcription of data into Microsoft Word (Microsoft, Inc) documents. Each actor had between 2 and 5 interactions with IT systems to capture all relevant data, a process that was reported to be time consuming and error prone. There was no interoperability within or across organizations, which led to delays as clinical teams manually transferred data, such as medical history and test results, via post or email.

Conclusions
Overall, data journey modeling demonstrated that human actors, rather than IT systems, formed the central focus of data movement. The IT landscape did not complement this workflow and exerted a significant administrative burden on clinical teams. Based on this study, future solutions must consider regional interoperability and specialty-specific views of data to support multi-organizational clinical services such as transplantation.},

	abstract = {Managers in complex organisations often have to make decisions on whether new software developments are worth undertaking or not. Such decisions are hard to make, especially at an enterprise level. Both costs and risks are regularly underestimated, despite the existence of a plethora of software and systems engineering methodologies aimed at predicting and controlling them. Our objective is to help managers and stakeholders of large, complex organisations (like the National Health Service in the UK) make better informed decisions on the costs and risks of planned new software systems that will reuse or extend their existing information infrastructure. We analysed case studies describing new software developments undertaken by providers of health care services in the UK, looking for common points of risk and high cost. The results highlighted the movement of data within and between organisations as a key factor. Data movement can be hindered by numerous technical barriers, but also by other challenges arising from social aspects of the organisation. These latter aspects are often harder to predict, and are ignored by many of the more common software engineering methodologies. In this paper, we propose data journey modelling, a new method aiming to predict places of high cost and risk when existing data needs to move to a new development. The method is lightweight and combines technical and social aspects, but relies only on information that is likely to be already known to key stakeholders, or will be cheap to acquire. To assess the effectiveness of our method, we conducted a retrospective evaluation in an NHS Foundation Trust hospital. Using the method, we were able to predict most of the points of high cost/risk that the hospital staff had identified, along with several other possible directions that the staff did not identify for themselves, but agreed could be promising.},

Different implementations of Huffman encoding incorporating the characteristics of DNA sequences prove to better compress DNA data. These implementations center on the concepts of selecting frequent repeats so as to force a skewed Huffman tree, as well as the construction of multiple Huffman trees when encoding. The implementations demonstrate improvements on the compression ratios for five genomes with lengths ranging from 5 to 50 Mbp, compared with the standard Huffman tree algorithm. The research hence suggests an improvement on all such DNA sequence compression algorithms that use the conventional Huffman encoding.
